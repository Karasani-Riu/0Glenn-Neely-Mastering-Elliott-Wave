"I've read everything I could find on Elliott and the understanding you've developedis more than I'd ever hoped for. The things you have taught me · in 2 months would have taken years to develop on my own.
I con see that the precise market timing I always thought possible is in fact
true when the (theory) is prorrly applied."

Is it possible to
predict the future?
Natural forces guide all
things in nature. Some of
these forces we understand,
some we do not. Those we
understand ollow us to make
predictions about the future.
for example, our underslanding of the earth's revolution
around the sun allows us to predict (and explain) the seasons and their repetition.
For those attempting to forecast economic activity
(i.e., the stock market, gold market, bonds, etc.), the
primary force at work is psychology. What people do
and how they feel about the future is a direct result of
their persona/ psychology. The price level of a market
is directly linked lo how people currently feel and what
they perceive to be its prospects for the future. The net
result of millions of people interacting-buying ond
selling goods and services, stocks and commoditiesproduces a pattern to economic development which is
a reAection of mass psychology. It follows that market
price action, being the by-product of what people
were willing to pay for goods and services, is a record
of the emotions of the people as o whole. As a result,
market price action is nothing more than the graphic
embodiment of mass opinion.
The Elliott Wave Theory, os introduced by R. N.
Elliott in the early 1930' s, defines, quantifies and
classifies the seemingly random undulations of mass
psychology (market action) into visual price patterns.
Since R.N. Elliott described psychological development as structurally repetitive phenomenon which
obeys common mathematical laws of progression,
studying the record of a market's price action will
provide you with strong clues on the current stale and
position of mass psychology (within a standardized
sequence) and its future economic ramifications.
Unfortunately, in its original form, many concepts
and ideas concerning real-time application of the
Elliott Wave Theory were left to the analyst to discover. After a decade of exhaustive research, realtime trading and teaching, Mr. Neely hos greatly ex· ponded upon and refined the concepts first discov- ered by R. N. Elliott lo help you more accurately apply
them to your tradingf investments and businesS endeavors. For the first time, these concepts are presented in a logical, step-by-step fashion, in the actual
order they should be applied to a price chart. Con·
sequentty, all guess work typical~ associated with the
Wave theory has been eliminated for you.
If you yearn for a greater understanding of the
dynamics of market price action, if you long for the
ability to predict the future (for profit or for fun), this
book will help you achieve that goal like no other.

Acknowledgments
This book has been nearly a decade in the making. During that period of time, a multitude of friends,
clients and associates have provided me with support, helped me solidify my ideas regarding the Wave
Theory and have indirectly assisted me in creating the knowledge which is presented in "Mastering
Elliott Wave." Some listed may not have realized or, through time, may have forgotten their impact on
my work. Here, I would like to remember them for their contributions.
First, the current and past "Elliott Wave Telephone Course" clients too numerous to all be mentioned,
but who were instrumental in the culmination of this treatise. A few should be singled out due to their
support beyond normal expectations: John Lux (my very first Course client -- you probably thought I
forgot about you); Jim Cottone, who gave me the encouragement and assistance to write my first book
(no longer available); George Limberg (a great student); John Porter (thanks for all the help during the
early newsletter days); Jo Roberts (for all the valuable statistics she provided); Percy Stokes (for his
generous support); Jay Walman (thanks for letting me on your show and for being a friend); Robert Blum
(a true believer); Bob Stark (who has been my friend longer than I can remember, and has always been
there when I needed him); Mark Brantley (one of the most devoted and helpful students I have ever
worked with); Mike Walker (who was not only a client, but a close, personal friend from my home town,
Lafayette, La. and who I will never forget - thanks for all the free computer time, charts and support);
Walter Koval (who, for personal reasons, gives me the greatest sense of accomplishment for having
taught); Donald Anderson (who currently holds the record for the highest number of retakes of my
Telephone course [six-times]) and finally and especially Jack Sumich (much more than a course client,
his belief and support have been incalculable).
Next, the close associates I would like to thank are: David Reif ( who provided me with some of the
most valuable knowledge I have ever learned about market behavior); Gerald Friedman (it has been a
pleasure working with you); Jeannine Henry (hope our relationship continues for a long time); Jim Barth
(the best broker I have ever known); Jeff Bower of Financial News Network for allowing me to be on
his program and for being the first one to establish my "Guru" status; Richard Mogey of the "Foundation
for the Study of Cycles" for maintaining the integrity of that organization and for allowing me to be one
of their occasional guest speakers; Larry Jacobs forinviting me to participate in his annual Conferences;
Irwin Mintz for his interest in expanding the Institute's horizons; Phyllis Kahn ( of Gann World) for being
such a caring and generous friend and a true lady; Perrin Gower for his promotional "plugs," ardent letter
writing and stimulating conversation; Robert Debnam, my best contact with Europe; Walter Murphy
(Merrill Lynch's resident Elliott Wave analyst); Michael Jachtschitz (for his valuable assistance and.
effort above and beyond the call of duty); Evans Design Associates for creating the powerful grapi{ics
on the front cover and finally, Steve Schmidt of Windsor Books for his interest in publishing "Mastering
Elliott Wave" and for letting me do it my way.
At this point I would like to thank a special group of friends who were invaluable in finalizing the
"infamous" rewrite of Chapter 3 (which took eight months), I call them my "beta" testers: Gary Long
(a long-time devotee of the Elliott Wave Institute, his ideas for Chapter3 were pivotal to its design), John
Kozma (the most enthusiastic tester of Chapter 3 who had some great ideas of his own), Richard
Schmoeller (thanks for all the time you spent error checking my rough drafts), John Lomas (thanks for
your ideas), Bill Wilson ( the most energetic Telephone Course client I have ever taught, thanks for your
input) and to Bill Abrams (that towering icon of the east coast who benevolently holds the "Big Apple"
in the palm of his hand).
This next person has been such a believer and promoter of my approach to Elliott Wave analysis you
would think he ran a P.R. firm and was charging me for the exposure. He has done so much to help me
over the years and has never asked for anything in return (but my friendship) that I feel it only appropriate
to devote an entire paragraph to giving him along over-due heart-felt "thank you." This wonderful fella's
name is Tim West. Thanks, Tim, for your assistance at my talks in New York City and Chicago in 1989,
thanks for proof-reading so many of my manuscripts over the last three years and for giving me your
opinions on promotional literature and thanks for all your terrific ideas regarding Chapter 3. Tim West
is everything you could expect from a friend and more. Even though we live on opposite coasts and I
virtually never see him in person, I feel Tim possesses all the qualities most people could only hope to
have. Tim, your a great friend ( I hope this makes up for any occasion in the past [ and future] when I have
not remembered to thank you for your help).
Furthermore, the following personal friends who have never stopped believing in me: Jeannie Bishop
(who has meant more to me than she will ever know); all the Aucoins (where can I begin -- Mrs. Aucoin -you're an inspiration to us all, Carla - I'll never forget you, you are the best friend I have ever had, Kevin - the most creative person I know, Kim and Doug, Keith and Mr. Aucoin); Eric Hall (without whom this
book could not have been done); Billy Leblanc
- thanks for being a friend; Claude
- a terrific and longterm friend, Kip-thanks for helping me get started; Travis, Chuck, Hanna and Wright -- the people to
know in New Orleans; Myrtle Blanchett, a realtor and an inspiration
- she wants things her way and
everyone steps aside to let her have it; Renee' Havig, the most feminine and well adjusted Chiropractor
on the west coast and to my wonderful brothers and sister (Bobby, Brent, Karen and Mark).
Finally, a standing ovation to my mother, Doris L. Neely, who provided the most ideal upbringing
imaginable, who has been an incredible pillar of strength (morally, financially, and psychologically) all
these years, and who has unconsciously implanted the drive for perfection and the confidence that
enabled me to create this book and who I miss very much ( additionally, who is the best proof-reader in
the state of Louisiana, helping to make "Mastering Elliott Wave" as error-free as possible•·· any errors
still remaining are exclusively of my own making).

Dedication
This book is dedicated to Richard J. Teweles, Charles V. Harlow and Herbert L. Stone. None of
these people have I met or talked with, but they are the authors of the book "The Commodity Futures
Game." It was while reading that book that I first set my eyes on the phrase "Elliott Wave Theory."
For me, that is where it all began.
T book wM writteo whh "" io,,m of sigoificmrly adwocing ,ho mbili,y of Elliou w,~
Theory by introducing a scientific, objective approach to market analysis. This innovative approach,
known as the Neely Method of Elliott Wave analysis, is the result of a decade of trading, teaching an~
extensive research by the author. In reading this book, you will quickly realize it is like no other you have
ever found on market analysis. Presented herein is the first step-by-step approach to Elliott Wave
analysis ever devised. No aspect of the Theory is left for you to ponder. Every detail is thoroughly
explained and, in the words ofBruce Babcock (Commodity Traders Consumer Reports), "every sentence
is devoted to something important."
The concept of the Wave Theory was originally presented to the investment world by R.N. Elliott
in the early 1930's. Going well beyond the original discoveries of Mr. Elliott, this book reveals new
techniques, rules and market price patterns never before disclosed to the public. These new discoveries
will dramatically increase your market forecasting accuracy and your confidence in trading.
"Mastering Elliott Wave" deals in great detail on the subject and application of the Neely Method.
In support of such detail, the accurate prediction and profitable trading of a market on a continuous basis
requires a complex understanding of economic and financial price activity. Another reason for this
extensive detail is to ensure the book serves as a valuable guide and reference for years to come.
If you desire the ability to forecast and profit from the complex undulations of economic activity, this
book will help you achieve that goal like no other. In addition, every effort has been made to create in
"Mastering Elliott Wave" a truly interactive learning environment which will allow you to follow the
book's instructions while simultaneously analyzing real-time market action. You will definitely find the
Neely Method to be challenging and I am confident you will find reading this book to be time well spent.
Now, turn the page and prepare yourself for a new adventure; your entrance into the world of high-tech
market analysis.

Price Patterns of Psychology
From an Elliott Wave perspective, the plotted price activity of a market is the graphical representation of crowd psychology. The Wave Theory describes how local plotted data relates to surrounding
data, how data should behave under a multitude of circumstances, when and how psychological trends
begin and end, how one psychological environment mandates the unfolding of another and what general·-
shape the price action should exhibit upon completion. In other words, the Elliott Wave Theory organizes
the seemingly random flow of market price action into identifiable, predictable patterns based on the
natural progression of crowd psychology.
Individuals behave in certain ways depending on their current opinions and feelings. When elated,
that individuals actions will invariably be distinctly different from the same individuals actions when
depressed. Just the way one person can feel excited or concerned about his or her personal future, the
same feelings can permeate and be manifested by society. When a majority of people have similar
feelings (favorable, unfavorable, indifferent) about their, or society's, prospects for the future, their
cumulative action unfolds in predictable patterns. In addition, the same way an individual can change
his or her mind over time (occasionally in an instant), so can the crowd. The Crash of 1987 was a good
example of an almost universal, "instant" change in the crowd's opinion of the stock market and the future
of the United States economy.
Once a certain psychological mood has run its course, people tend to get bored with an idea or concept
(sometimes financially ruined by them), so they grab onto new ideas. It is this changing from one mood
to the next that terminates one psychological trend (price pattern) and begins another.
Natural, Non-Periodic Phenomenon
The amount of time consumed by a specific pan-societal mood appears to have no absolute minimum
or maximum time requirement, but there are general limits. By analyzing previously completed patterns
and applying certain principles of time behavior, it is possible to approximate the best time periods for
completion of a formation. These techniques, many of which I have developed over the last ten years,
will be discussed in later chapters.
Elementary Discussions 1-1
The "structure" of market movement should almost always supersede time observations. Some
~eople con~ider_this ~ annoying aspect of the Theory since they want to know "when" to make a trade,
in advance. Elhott virtually proves that absolute anticipation of market movement is impossible. The
gre_atest degree of predictability occurs immediately after a move has terminated. In other words, you
wait for a pattern to complete, then you take action.
A Unique Analytical Tool
Unlike most fonns of technical analysis, the Wave Theory was developed strictly from a price
behavior standpoint. The Theory helps the analyst realize that whatever the market does, it does for a
reason. There is no "chance" in market activity, no aberrations and no unclassifiable price behavior.
A large portion of market technicians spend their time trying to manipulate price data to find that
"magical" key-indicator. How can a transformation of price data be better than the original data? In other
words, price should be considered the ultimate indicator. It is the only indicator of market action that
can be absolutely depended on and the only one that directly affects your bottom line. It does not make
any difference what someone thinks or what an indicator signals, the bottom line is, "what did the market
do?" If prices are going up (and you are long), you make money. If prices are going down (and you are
long) you lose money, all other indicators notwithstanding.
Some of the remarkable aspects of the Elliott Wave Theory are:
1. Its adaptability to new technological developments and unexpected fundamental news;
2. Its thoroughness in describing ALL possible market behavior; and
3. Its progressive and dynamic characteristics.
T~e Theo~ inherently indicates man, and his markets, continually charts new territory and types of
~ha:1or. It stipulates that at no point in history is a market's action or psychological environment
1dent1cal to any other period. Similarities are allowed, but not exact duplication. This can be a problem
for traders, and especially "system" developers, who endeavor to formulate strategies based on historic
price action and behavior. Unlike most systems and forms of analysis, the Wave Theory warns the
analyst to look for change and warns him when and where a market will not behave as it has in the past.
The "Elli~tt" point of view, that "history does not repeat exactly," is the perfect explanation of why
m~st_mech'.1111cal syst~ms (and other fonns of analysis based on the expectation of exact repetition) fail.
This is parucularly evident when a market changes from a bullish to bearish environment, or vice versa.
!he computer age has dramatically (and probably permanently) altered certain aspects of the trading
envrronment and thus market behavior. This is an example of why working with historical data way back
to "who knows when" will not necessarily make a mechanical system function any better. Ever
expanding technology continuously transforms the decision element of the market, people. The way
people react to, use and learn from new technology cannot be decided by historical study. A form of
analysis which explains, categorizes and structures progress, not repetition, is needed. That is what the
Elliott Wave Theory is capable of doing.
1-2 Elementary Discussions
Additional Examples
The 1987 crash was a perfect illustration of how a study of history could not have prepared one for
what happened October 19, 1987. Even the largest declining day during the crash of 1929 was only half
as detrimental (percentage-wise) as the one experienced in 1987. Anyone using the 1929 crash as a
barometer may have decided to buy the market after it had fallen 10% or so the day of October 19, 1987,
expecting no day to be worse than that experienced in 1929. Of course, anyone taking such an approach
would have been in for a very unpleasant surprise.
During the 1987 advance, I remember continually hearing people talk about (and seeing ads espouse)
the extreme similarities between 1982-1987 and 1920-1929. They assumed everything would continue
on course exactly (same time and percentage advance), with the 80's bull market repeating the nine year
boom as if it were another 1920-1929. Unfortunately, those who believed such an easy comparison of
history was their road to riches may now be doing something besides investing in the stock market.
Why Learn Elliott Wave Theory?
lmlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Ill I I I I I I I I I I II I I I I
To the beginning student, the Theory's complexity, multiple pattern variations, "alternate count"
possibilities and apparent subjectivity seem almost insurmountable and appear to nullify the Theory's
validity. This is due to the extreme demand of specifics required of the Elliott Wave analyst. All general
pattern categories, and each of its variations, requires different relationships, channeling, price behavior
and technical characteristics. This creates the illusion that the Theory is purely subjective and can be
molded to fit anyone's opinion. While there may have been some justification for this stance in the pas('~-
before the publication of this book, this simply is not true anymore. The Pre-Constructive and PostConstructive Rules of Logic (Chapters 3 & 6, respectively), in collaboration with numerous, completely new techniques developed by the author over many years, will greatly enhance your ability to
arrive at a single wave pattern conclusion. ~: These techniques, and the specifics involved in
applying them, are so numerous and varied that their proper application can take years of practice and
real-time trading. As a result, until you thoroughly understand the concepts presented in this book, your
conclusions may frequently be incorrect.
Multiple Benefits
The long-term benefits of "Mastering Elliott Wave" are numerous. As a business person or investor,
you can frequently anticipate major changes in the economic environment allowing you to sidestep
disaster or even profit from the winds of change. Proper understanding of crowd psychology (the
fundamental basis of the Theory) can help you avoid financially dangerous business dealings at the end
of an economic cycle.
Multi-area application
The Wave Theory can be applied to virtually all areas of mass human endeavor: the stock market,
commodities, real estate, production of goods and services, etc.; all that is required is accurate, consistent
data. The benefits of the Theory's multi-area application are obvious.
Elementary Discussions 1-3
Numerous Techniques Unnecessary
When incorporating Elliott's original rules and observations with the Neely Method and the new
techniques revealed in this book, you have at your disposal a virtually all encompassing description of
market behavior and how to decipher it. This allows you to know, undermost circumstances, a great deal
about the current position of a market without any information other than price action. You will not need
to keep track of numerous time consuming ( and sometimes subjective) indicators.
Remember, no matter how good a mechanical system or indicator works during a particular period
in history, the minute the pattern (which was unfolding during the formation of the system) completes,
that system or indicator will usually not work anymore. The environment in which it was designed to
perform so perfectly no longer exists and (according to the Wave Theory) will never exist again.
Helpful in Indicator Clarification
If you decide to use other indicators (outside of Elliott) to "clarify" wave counts, the Wave Theory
is actually instructive in qualifying where and when a particular indicator does and does not work.
Example:
Readings of investor sentiment normally indicate a significant market turning point only when in
overbought or oversold territory (usually considered to be around 75% and 35%, respectively). A
comprehensive understanding of Elliott patterns allowed me to recognize in 1986 and 1987 that
sentiment could oscillate around neutral readings even if a major market turning point was forming. This
was a logical deduction based on an understanding of Horizontal Triangles and Terminal patterns (ex.
Gold Jan.-June 1986 and S & P 500 Jan. - Sept. 1987). When most were confused by the lack of public
excitement generated during the 1987 stock market advance, I constantly warned clients that was a sign
a Terminal Impulse wave (diagonal triangle) started in the lastquarterof 1986 and would portend a crash,
in three months or less, back to 1900 on the DOW and 230 on the S&P 500 Cash Index.
Signals Infrequent, but Reliable
Only after an identifiable pattern is complete is it safe or desirable to enter a market. This helps avoid
over-trading and prevents entering the market when there is little potential. On the other hand, it
promotes trading when the probabilities are greatly in your favor and risk is at a minimum. The Theory
also allows for the placement of very objective stops, enabling you to know when in time and where in
price your interpretation is wrong. What else could a trader ask for?
Why the Controversy?
1111m1wm1m1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 1
Complexity
The Wave Theory is probably the most complex and all encompassing form of market analysis ever
devised. It requires a lot of time and practice to master. As a result, most people do not have the time
nor inclination to properly learn or apply it. The Theory takes more time to perfect than most people are
willing to commit. In addition, the idea of an analytical technique allowing someone to call market
1-4 Elementary Discussions
turning points to the day, even the hour, is considered by most to be ridiculous or at least suspect. When
a majority of investors have trouble being on the right side of a market, attempting to pick the highest
or lowest tick of a trend is not even considered a serious possibility. A Theory which professes to produce
such astounding results will always create controversy and be treated with skepticism by the uninitiated.
Public Mind Set
Profitable application of the Wave Theory requires a mentality divergent from the norm. To
accurately call market turning points demands you buck the crowd precisely at the time the majority is
most convinced an event will occur (you may possibly even be ridiculed for your beliefs, one of the most
reliable signs your analysis is correct). Extreme self-confidence is a must; control of greed, strict money
management (which includes risk control), an open mind and the ability to change your entire perspective
(from bullish to bearish or vice versa) in the blink of an eye are all necessary attributes and abilities of
the successful analyst and/or trader. Most of these characteristics are not all present in one person,
making it difficult to be a prognosticator and profitable investor. Many people can predict future market
action when no money of their own is at risk. When trading becomes personal, everything changes.
Years to Master
Even if you had all of the qualities mentioned above, it could take years of practice to confidently
and accurately apply the Theory to real-time. Since most people will not spend the time necessary to
properly learn the Theory, they misapply it and lose money in the market. This creates disgruntled "exstudents" who, of course, blame their misfortune on the Theory, thus continuing the controversy.
Application Requires Time
Even if you have the mentality and the years of experience and knowledge, you still must spend time
analyzing everyday or so to stay in practice and keep up with the current position of a market. If you are
following numerous markets, this alone can take several or more hours everyday.
On many occasions, I have spent an entire weekend looking at one market, sometimes just one chart,
trying to figure a way to fit all the important elements of a good count into the price patterns. Most people
want making money in the market (and all other endeavors) to be easy. They work all day at another job,
go out to eat, go to the movies, then right before going to bed in the evening, spend 5 or 10 minutes on
their charts to "decide" what the market is going to do the next day.
This is just one of many reasons most people never make money trading. If you are in the above
mentioned category, you are competing against a handful of devoted, full-time professionals who derive
their sustenance from profitable trading or investing. The chances of a part-timer consistently winning
against this group are small. If you are not able to spend the time required to follow markets properly,
it is recommended you find a professional who can advise you on your investments.
Endless Array of Specifics
To apply Elliott Wave properly under all circumstances requires the application of an almost endless
array of specific criteria fitting particular situations. Relationships, channeling, the significance of
certain turning points to the over all picture, Structure (Impulsive or Corrective and what type of
Impulsion and Correction) all need to be considered when piecing together a pattern's count.
Elementary Discussions 1-5
Memorization
From the statements on the previous pages, it should be obvious that a large amount of information
needs to be memorized in order to hasten the application of important Elliott Wave and Neely techniques
to a price series. This memorization is one of the major obstacles most students encounter to successful
application of the Wave Theory to real-time action.
Frequent Indeterminacy
The price or time termination area of a trend is not predictable, with a high degree of confidence, until
an Elliott Wave pattern is on the verge of completion. Sometimes, confidence is not obtainable until .afu.!:
a pattern has completed. This fact keeps most of the public suspicious about the Theory. Why? If you
ask an Elliottician for his prediction of future market activity before a pattern is near completion, the
probabilities are high his analysis will be wrong, at least in detail. As the market approaches the end of
a move, the pattern in progress begins to become clear. As it moves away from the identified turning 1 point of a previous pattern and moves toward the middle of a new pattern, the number of possible patterns
in progress again increases. This is the reason experienced Elliott analysts can disagree on the position
of a market during certain time periods; each is choosing what he or she considers to be the best scenario
of the interpretations possible.
When experts in the same field continuously disagree on the same subject, that is the very foundation
of controversy. In a latter chapter, a whole new concept developed by the author, will be introduced to
handle these areas of"uncenainty" (see Expansion of Possibilities - Page 12-43).
Difficulty
The extreme complexity, subtlety, and demanding nature of the Wave Theory prevents most people
from pursuing this area of analysis. Also, most of the reasons listed throughout Chapter 1 prevent the
Theory from being completely computerized. Application of the Theory sometimes demands forms of
abstract thought, not a specialty of the computer realm. For example, application of all the rules under
certain circumstances may leave no obvious possibilities. These situations require personal brainstorming sessions to "unlock" the count or, sometimes, merely patience to wait for a count to reveal itself.
Mastery of this form of analysis will be applicable for the rest of your life. There is no need to concern
yourself with the possibility of heavy public participation, most will apply it wrong. As Elliott has
become increasingly popular, the wave patterns in most markets, to compensate, have begun to develop
on an ever more complex level preventing amateur Elliotticians from correctly deciphering market
behavior. Again, this helps to perpetuate the controversy in favor of the Theory's inadequacy or, at the
very least, its supposed subjectivity.
Why This Book May Create More Controversy
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I I I I I I I I I I I
The degree of detail covered in this book will sir:nificantly increase the number of important rules
and guidelines that have to be memorized to properly apply the Theory. Most people feel there are
~ too many rules associated with Elliott Wave.
1-6 Elementary Discussions
Many experienced practitioners will disagree with some of the findings in this book proclaiming "my
wave behavior criteria is too specific or demanding to be applied to real-time market action." This is
absolutely not true. It is understandable, though, how these feelings might have come about in others.
Many practitioners have, for years, used data to plot their charts which is inaccurate or improperly plotted
forcing them into invalid conclusions. This obviously would affect their perception of the Wave Theory.
When data is inconsistent (which it will be when collected and plotted incorrectly), it is impossible to
analyze a market's action with exactitude. [For a more detailed description of what constitutes good data
and how to plot it, see "How Do You Plot Data To Analyze Waves," in Chapter 2.]
What Makes Elliott Wave Theory Unique?
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I I I I I I I I I
Complete Perspective
Unlike most all mechanical systems and many analytical techniques, the Elliott Wave Theory allows
the analyst to study any time frame: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. Even more interesting,
the analyst can study all time frames simultaneously, allowing a decision to be made on which time frame
currently provides the greatest trading environment and how all the long and short-term movements
interplay with one another.
Quantification of Mass Psychology
Even if a system or technique tells you what to do in the market, rarely will it give you a feeling for
the economic outlook of a society or of the psychology overshadowing all market action. Due to the
Theory's mathematical quantification of mass psychology, it allows you to experience the economic
"boom and bust" phenomenon with greater interest and understanding.
Detailed Categorization
Almost in a class by itself, Elliott allows for the categorization of moves which cover just a few
seconds in length up to hundreds of years. Every move on a price chart has its effect on the larger patterns
that are evolving and each can be labeled based on its specific impact. If you know what type of pattern
is unfolding, you have a better idea of what to expect from that move in the area of speed, complexity,
breadth, volume, etc. (many of these areas will be covered later).
Grand Simplification
The whole Elliott Wave analysis process involves the deciphering of small price patterns, combining
those with numerous others into larger price patterns and then reducing those complex patterns back into
simpler patterns again. This is what makes the Theory so unique; development is the same on all scales.
Clear Delineation of Price Behavior
No matter how small or large a trend turns out to be, you can clearly label the movement as an upward
correction in a downtrend, a downward correction in an uptrend, etc.

How Should You Learn the Theory?
lllllllmllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I I
Reading this book is a good start! "Mastering Elliott Wave" (the book and the process) requires a
lot of real-time practice. Initially, your charts should be constructed on a short-term basis until you grasp
the basic concepts. Memorization of numerous rules is required along with an understanding of general
shapes and channeling. It is recommended you follow no more than one market until you have
memorized the basic rules and can quickly apply them to a market as it unfolds in real-time.
Why Another Book on Elliott Wave was Necessary
111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I I I
Additional Techniques Required
The purpose of this book is to provide new, introductory methods to assure objective application of
the Theory and, in later chapters, discuss more subtle qualifying techniques. These will be required by
the experienced analyst to enhance the wave tracking process. These techniques can be employed even
when the market is developing on a very complicated basis, eliminating the need to resort to other types
of less reliable indicators or techniques.
Specific Procedures Described
Despite the preponderance of information now available on Elliott, most people interested in the
subject do not know where to begin when trying to apply it to real-time. The approach in this book is
to logically progress from the simplest concepts (many of which were developed for the benefit of my
course clients), to the more complex as each stage of wave analysis is understood. In addition, exact startup procedures and data-plotting methods will be explained in detail.
Realistic Diagrams Previously Non-Existent
Even in Elliott's original works, diagrams of market behavior were very poor and unrepresentative
of real-time market action. In my early days of fighting with the Theory, those diagrams were a strong
influence on my thinking. The idealized patterns presented never reflected actual market behavior. Any
student familiar with Elliott's original works will greatly appreciate the attention to "real-life" detail
present in the charts of this book. In the early sections of the book, the "typical" diagrams are used to
instill the general shape of each Elliott pattern, but they are quickly discarded later for more accurate
representations.
Disclosure of Advanced Concepts
Even though general descriptions of Elliott's tenets can be found in all writings on the subject, very
little is available on advanced techniques and applications. It is in that area that this book really excels.

Original Presentation Sequence
The difficulty most students have in the early stages of learning Elliott Wave is mostly due to the
standard method of presentation. A lot of importance is placed on what I call "Progress Labels"
(1,2,3,4,5,a,b,c) too early in most publications. That area of knowledge is oflittle importance in the early
learning stages; it just tends to confuse if discussed too soon. Also, far too much significance is placed
on Degree in Elliott's work and its spinoffs. If there is any aspect of the Wave Theory that is subjective,
Degree is it. For the above reasons, both concepts are presented after more basic ideas are covered.
New Terminology
The difficulty of discussing the Wave Theory over the phone to clients and in book form required
the creation of new terminology in order to convey precise meanings. Some coined words and phrases
were also needed to describe new discoveries and techniques covered in this book. In addition, a few
old terms have been renamed for clarity. Many "Standard and Non-Standard" Elliott patterns have been
broken down into more specific sub-categories. This was done to aid the application of"pattern specific"
rules and guidelines which will enhance your forecasting accuracy and pattern interpretation.
New Discoveries, The Neely Extensions
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I I I I I I
Initially, I intended to include a separate section on lll! the new discoveries ( channeling, Fibonacci,
price, time, structure, patterns, degree, relativity, momentum) I had made over the years. This proved
too difficult. For the completeness of each section, the presentation of only old informationfirst and then
new information later would have required introducing all the same categories twice. For reasons of
continuity and space preservation, each new technique, concept or discovery has been introduced at its
proper place with the assumption that the reader will clearly detect the presence of "never before
presented" information. The value of these Extensions to Elliott's work will be proven to anyone who
applies them properly. For those new techniques, concepts and discoveries which~ be included
in the normal flow of the text, there are several sections toward the end of the book which present
information that has either never been presented before (i.e., Rule of Similarity and Balance, The Neely
Extensions, Complexity Rule, Power Ratings, Logic Rules, Emulation, Reverse Logic Rule, Missing
Waves, etc.) or have only been~ but never explained in detail (i.e., Structure Series, the dominance
of Structure over Progress Labels, Compaction, Progress Label Application, the importance of
Channeling, the differences between Extensions and Subdivisions, etc.).

The Telephone Course
When I started my studies of the Wave Theory, many things appeared to be missing from available
literature on the subject. Questions like; "where do you start a chart, how do you organize charts, how
Elementary Discussions 1-9
do you plot price action, how do you analyze and treat a near vertical advance or decline on a price chart
that exhibits no up and down price action?" came to mind. This, along with the frustration I experienced
when wrong about the direction of a market's move, kept me searching for answers. Refusing to believe
a market could outwit me, I believed with enough time and work the Theory could be reduced to a
scientific approach where all market action could be explained and most future action could be
anticipated. My purpose was to eliminate any subjectivity in the analysis process, therefore allowing
rational, logical trading decisions to prevail.
In an attempt to explain market action which did not fit into the Wave Theory as R.N. Elliott described
it, I set out to quantify every unquantified facet. As part of this study, eight years of notes were kept on
all manner of market behavior in an attempt to classify and regiment market action above and beyond
Elliott's original discoveries.
Most of what I have discovered has come from teaching a "one of a kind" Telephone Course on the
Theory since 1983. Due to this detailed teaching process, new ways of presenting the Theory to
beginners, important wave behavior discoveries (sometimes very subtle and specific), Channeling
techniques, Fibonacci relationships and charting approaches emerged. Through constant application
and research, I believe I have quantified almost every, up till now, unquantified aspect of the Theo'?'.
Long Hours ofW ork
Since I generally work seven days a week, ten to fifteen hours a day and have been studying this
subject since I 980, I estimate I have logged more than 30,000 hours in the study of Elliott Wave Theory.
This alone was a good breeding ground for new ideas.
Where is the Theory Applicable?
lilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
The Wave Theory manifests itself in markets that have broad public appeal and involvement.
Markets that are more susceptible to weather and other natural events are less reliable followers of the
Wave Theory since the weather is not dependent on human thoughts or actions. Many individual stock
issues are not broadly based enough to set into motion this natural law of mass human psychology and
so may not yield consistent results. On the other hand, markets such as gold, broadly bas_ed st~k
averages or real estate ( even though reliable data is harder to obtain for real estate), work well smce httle
can happen to change the value of the commodity or index except human action. Virtually an~ mass
human endeavor will exhibit predictable progress as long as there is consistent, reliable data avaJ!able.
How Should You Work with and Perceive Elliott?
llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I l I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
Meticulously
All market action needs to be accounted for and classified to produce bankable interpretations.
Counts should be built from the ground up on a "molecular" basis. Do not start the analysis process by
trying to interpret a long-term price chart first. The long-term count is the by-product of all the shortterm studies. Keep your short-term analysis accurate and the long-term possibilities will usually become
evident as they unfold.
1-10 Elementary Discussions
Once charts are organized on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, the analyst should patiently work
with the short-term data until a clearly definable pattern appears. Later it will be discussed what to do
with the completed pattern and what part of the whole the pattern becomes.
The Elliott Wave Theory is the graphic representation of a natural law which is continuously at work
in all areas of mass human activity. As an analyst working with the Theory, do not try to create count
scenarios or force the market into a pattern which would favor your current opinion of where the market
should be headed. Let each pattern evolve, then objectively deduce how that pattern, based on the highest
probabilities, fits into a grander scheme.
Elliott frequently allows you the pleasure (intellectually and financially) of calling major turning
points to the day or even the hour. At these junctures you will be a "lone voice in the woods." If you
have the courage to act on your convictions, the Elliott Wave Theory will produce results for you.
Open-Mindedly
To properly apply the Theory requires an open-mind to all possibilities. Never begin the analysis of
a market with a preconceived scenario and then attempt to mold an Elliott count which would verify your
opinions. Your conclusions should be the by-product of a carefully constructed wave count. Also, try
to avoid all optimistic or pessimistic impulses. When all techniques are followed correctly, you do not
need to make a guess, the completed wave count will virtually tell you what price level the market should
reach and in what time frame that should happen.

The next chapter of this book, General Concepts, is designed to answer basic questions you may
have about the Wave Theory, but - until now - have gone unanswered. The third chapter, Preliminary
Analysis, describes how to prepare and maintain chart data, how to identify waves, properly observe
wave interaction and much more. Chapter 3 contains the most complete and methodical explanation of
price analysis available. These techniques will allow the novice to accurately decipher even the most
complex market conditions. The fourth chapter, Intennediary Observations, discusses how to combine
individual waves into acceptable groups to form "standard" Elliott formations. Chapter 5, Central
Considerations, advances further into the construction of specific Elliott patterns with numerous rules
explained to eliminate unsatisfactory wave development. Chapter 6 introduces the Post-Constructive
Rules of Logic discovered by the author. These rules will describe how to confinn the authenticity of
patterns you have identified. Chapter 7, Conclusions, will help you solidify your wave patterns, simplify
their Structure and prepare them for future use. Chapters 9-12 contain a vast array of mostly new pattern
formulation, testing and verification techniques.

What is a "Wave"?

It seems quite remarkable that the basis of the Wave Theory, "waves," has never -to my knowledge
- been defined in any literature ever available on the subject. To make sense and be of use, a wave must
be described in specific tenns with absolu.te limits. A more general definition will be offered later, after
you have been introduced to some additional concepts.
The obvious place to start with the definition of a "wave" is in its simplest fonn. Since waves refer
to the movement of a market, and markets are measured in price, the definition will depend on references
to price action. Clearly, the simplest price movement on a chart would be comprised of a straight line
of any length moving in any direction - except parallel to the y-axis on an x-y plane (see Figure 2-1 on
the next page).

Time Time
All of these diagrams represent reliable price
action except the bottom right. To materialize, price action requires a "unit" of time
elapse ("unit" is described later in this
chpater). Therefore, absolutely vertical
price movement isimpossible.
To describe this type of action (which is paramount to our discussions throughout this book) it was
necessary to coin a new tenn: Monowave (see Fig. 2-2). A Monowave is the movement of a market
starting/rom a change in price direction until the next change in price direction occurs and is the
simplest type of''wave." In Figure 2-3a, the starting point "m" is where the price changed direction/ rom
its previous course. The point labeled "n" is where the next change in price action occurred. Between
any "m" and "n" you usually witness a straight line. Except when the Rule of Neutrality is applied
(explained in detail in Chapter 3), even if price action does slow down temporari.ly and then speeds up
again, (see Figure 2-3b) the entire advance or decline should be considered one "wave" (a monowave)
until price actually changes direction; when it does, the "Wave" is over.
Monowaves are the micro components (the building blocks) of all wave patterns. Learning how to
decipher monowaves is your first step toward understanding Elliott Wave Theory. Remember, all
market patterns and trends (no matter how large), begin with a single move. Unfortunately, analyzing
every move a market makes is tedious, but usually necessary to correctly interpret the larger picture
accurately on a consistent basis.

Why Do Waves Occur?

"Waves" are the result of imbalances which occur between the number of buy and sell orders on an· ·-
exchange floor or in the open market, for whatever reason. When demand for a product, in relation to
its supply, is increasing (or in the case with commodities, the total number of "buy" orders exceeds the
total number of "sell" orders) the price goes up; this event could be called an "up-wave." When demand
for a product, relative to its supply, is decreasing (in commodities, the sell orders overpower the buy
orders), the price falls creating a "down-wave." Each time one force overpowers another, even for the
shortest period of time, a change in price direction occurs which starts a new wave. These supply and
demand forces are continuously falling into and out of balance on scales of varying magnitude (Degree).
Why are Waves Important?

Finances
Market movement is composed of waves which continually combine to fonn larger waves with larger
reactions. Accurate analysis of a market's wave patterns can give you an overview of current economic
conditions. As a businessman, investoror speculator, an understanding of these conditions could directly
affect your financial status and standard of living by allowing you to profit from circumstances few are
expecting.
Psychology
When a market moves in a particular direction for a long period of time, it tends to attract the media
who then alerts the public ( the crowd). The longer a market moves in one direction, the easier it becomes
General Concepts 2-3
for the "crowd" to believe the trend will never stop or believe the trend will continue much farther than
current levels. These feelings affect how people conduct business, especially if itis in an area of personal
interest. It will affect how they invest, bank, entertain, consume, etc. How much many people spend,
and on what they spend it, affects a whole list of other people and industries. Even if a person is not
involved in speculating or investing, he can be affected by the events in the stock and commodity markets.
Patterns
Correct combinations of individual monowaves create larger, recognizable patterns. Elliott discovered '.hat certain types of action can be depended upon when specific patterns occur. Through much
practtce and hard work, it is possible to reach a point where you can predict, occasionally with great
accuracy, the price and time extent of a market move. Of course, the regular display and application of
such skill can produce great financial rewards.
How Do You Categorize Waves?
lllllffllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I II I I I I I I I I
Classes
All market movement under Elliott falls into two, logical Classes:
Impulsions ( trending & terminal patterns): These are the patterns which occur in the direction of the
trend. When analyzing short-term market movement, Impulsions gm be monowaves. If the Impulsion
is more complex than a monowave, it will be composed of five (5) segments.
Co"ections (non-trending patterns): These are the patterns which occur against the trend. Corrections can also be monowaves but, if more complex, will generally appear as sideways consolidations
on a price chart and are usually composed of three (3) segments.
These concepts will be covered in increasingly greater detail as you progress throughout this book.
Degree
"Degree" is a broad, rather nebulous term detailing the hierarchical stratification of waves based on
price and time interrelationships. If you closely study a price chart of any market, it should be obvious
some waves consume a lot of time, some do not. Some waves consume a lot of price, some do not. A
wave which consumes a far greater amount of time and price than another should always be considered
a larger degree move. More specific definitions of Degree are gradually introduced over the next several
Chapters to ease you into the concept.
With waves of different sizes simultaneously present on a chart, Degree, to be employable, must be
thought of in relative "levels" of price complexity/time duration. Degree can never be described or
applied in absolute terms. In other words,just because a move takes a week, a month, a year, $1, $10,
$100 does not make it a particular Degree. All that can be derived from a pattern which takes a month
or$ 100 is that a pattern of the same degree will probably take a comparable amount of time and/or price.
The specific limits ofDegree commonality will be partially discussed in Intermediary Observations (see
"Rule of Similarity and Balance," Chapter 4) along with specific quantification rules.
Once you chooses a Degree label and symbol for a particular move Degree takes on a more concrete
meaning. Why? A frame of reference is created allowing comparisons to be made among all other
2-4 General Concepts
moves. This frame of reference will provide you with enough information to begin calling certain moves
by certain names. The names will imply how a move relates to another, not how big or small it is
inherently. Due to the esoteric nature of the Degree concept, it is advised if you are a beginning student
to not spend much time or pay much attention to this area of the Wave Theory until a greater
understanding of more important basics is achieved.
How Do You Label Waves?
IIIW!llllllllllllllllllllllllllltllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I
Once individual monowaves have been identified, they will have to be classified. This involves the
application of structure labels.
Structure Labels
As mentioned in the last section, all market action is placed into one of two categories. Out of
necessity, each category must be given a symbol for use in marking price action. This will enable you
to quickly note into which "Class" a particular move falls.
Deciding on the symbols needed to represent wave Structure was not difficult. As indicated in the
last section, Impulsive patterns should always be comprised of - or thought to be comprised of - five (5)
individual segments. Corrections are usually comprised of three (3) individual segments. Therefore, the
symbol to represent Impulsive action is the number five ( 5) preceded by a colon (i.e., ":5"). To represent
corrective action, the symbol ":3" is used. The colon before each number is there to prevent any direct···•-
connection to additional forms of labeling which you will implement later in the analysis process.
Structure labels are critical on all levels of application to the Wave Theory. They must be applied
to waves of all shapes, sizes and complexities. Structure labels inform you whether a movement is with
or against the trend "of one larger degree." Proper attention to structure labels will aid you in answering
that ubiquitous market question, "which way is the market going?"
Organiza.tion
After having designated numerous monowaves on a chart with a ":3" or a ":5," you will be able to
follow the market's development into more advanced stages. To achieve this, the specific serialization
of those ":3' s" and" :5' s" into groups will be necessary. The groups created from the serialization process
will be given different names ( another form of categorization beyond Structure labeling) which not only
indicate their CLASS (Impulsive or Corrective), but their general appearance (shape).
Progress Labels
As you become more proficient at the basic labeling concepts presented in this book, more advanced
forms of labeling will eventually need to be mastered. Progress Labels are a dramatic step for the
beginner. The complexity of this subject is such that a whole Chapter is devoted to it later. A brief
introduction follows to familiarize you with the concept, but complete coverage is scheduled for later.
Progress Labels are an essential and critical part of testing a group of waves for proper development.
They direct the analyst "down a narrow path," guiding him through certain conditions and observations
which are relevant to the current environment. Progress Labels provide order and limits to a market's
General Concepts 2-5
movement, allowing the skilled technician to finalize his opinions and prepare strategies to take
advantage of a move which "should" take place in the future.
Unlike Structure labels (:3's and :S's), which represent the inherent numberof segments in a pattern,
Progress Labels identify the position of each segment within a standardized pattern. The five segments
in an Impulse pattern are labeled as such: "1,2,3,4,5." Even though there are generally only three
segments to a correction, exceptions do occur. For this reason, more than three labels are needed, at times,
to describe all types of Corrective behavior. The various segments of Corrective market action are given
the first three or more of the following letters: "a,b,c,d,e,x."
When referring to market action with the use of a Progress label, use the word "wave" in front of it.
For example, if you are discussing a move which meets all the criteria and inherent characteristics of
Progress label "1," you should referto that move as "wave l." This may seem mundane to experienced
Elliotticians, but it may not be obvious to the beginner, so is included for completeness.
In addition, to make things perfectly clear, each Progress label is placed next to the termination of
the market action it represents. The labels are placed in order from left to right as each segment unfolds.
In other words, wave-2 cannot be marked until wave-1 is completed.
Finally, keep in mind that Progress labels should not be implemented until you become familiar with
numerous preliminary and secondary procedures covered in this book. For this reason, the discussion
and application of Progress Labels is reserved for Chapter 5.
What Data Should be Used to Analyze Waves?
1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I I I I I
Closing Price Data
The use of closing prices on a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis is the most unreliable way to
track development of a market from an Elliott Wave standpoint. The closing price of a market has little
to do with the action which took place intra-monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly. It will not give you any
idea of how high or low the market traded during a particular period (Figures 2-4a & 2-4b illustrate why
this is the case), thus making it virtually impossible to apply the wide range of"pattern specific" criteria
presented in this book. For example, a market could rally 10 points during the first hour of the day, close
near the low of that hour, drop 20 points the next hour, recover and close where it closed the previous
hour. Under those circumstances, the plotting of closing data would not accurately represent reality.
Therefore, closing figures - over any time frame -should never be used unless nothing else is available.
If you want to employ hourly data, the correct way of collecting data is revealed on page 2-9 (see Cash
Data, #2). Proper plotting of data, collected over any time frame, is discussed on page 2-11.
BarCharts
Bar charts reveal what a market has done in the past by showing the trading range which existed over
a standardized portion of time plotted on a single, vertical line (Figure 2- 4c). The problem with bar
charts, from an Elliott perspective, is they do not possess the necessary qualities to allow for the analysis
of waves in absolute terms. If you were to draw a line across only the highs or lows of some price action,
you would have a band of price action similar to Figure 2-4d. This produces the right idea, but is still
not the best representation of the entire day's price action. The motion is important, but to correctly
interpret market action requires data be of a singular nature. The price action on a bar chart consists of
dual price factors occurring simultaneously, the high and low. Only one figure per time period should

Each heavy dot is the final price each hour on the hour (Figure 2-4a). The exact same chart and dots
are reproduced below, minus the intra-hour action (Figure 2-4b ). Each hourly closing was connected
with a straight line. The result is not even representative of the above chart. Since market patterns do
not develop on a specific time schedule, it is quite illogical to think the closing of each hour (one second
out of3600) is going to occur right at the precise moment a pattern finishes, right at the high or low. Just
based on probabilities, the hourly close will virtually J!.11m occur at the proper moment to register the
highest and lowest price of the day. In future chapters, when relationships are used to verify wave
patterns, it is critical the actual highs and lows are recorded (or a reliable representation of those highs
and lows). It should be clear from this example that hourly closings are not the way to plot price action.

Only one figure per time period should be employed so it is possible to decide how each figure changes
(if at all) the current expectations and possibilities of the market. This does not mean only one figure
per day should be used for your analysis, simply that a single figure per time unit ( whatever that time unit
is -one day, week, hour, etc.) is optimal. This allows you to arrive at a definitive conclusion on current
market conditions and future expectations. A price band (the bar line on a bar chart) does not enable you
to make an absolute, immediate decision on current and future market possibilities (see Figure 2-5).

~~
X
For this example, let us assume the market experiences a violent day. When looking at a chart you
notice the price action for one day is above and below the previous day's high and low. This creates a
dilemma. Proper analysis requires you know which of the two ( the high or the low) came first to make
a decision on whether price action is continuing as it should or deviating from the assumed path,
indicating changes in opinion are necessary. Therefore, bar charts should be avoided when employing
Elliott Wave Theory. Reasons for this will become clearer as you progress through the book.
Futures Charts
Futures charts present a unique problem to the application of the Wave Theory. They contain an
element of"deterioration." When dealing with distant Futures contracts in most commodities, the Cash
market trades well below the Futures price. As expiration of the Futures contract draws near, the Futures
2-8 General Concepts
price will approach the cash and, for most markets, will be equal at expiration. Occasionally, supply and
demand factors in some of the agricultural commodities can create severe imbalances which prevent the
Futures from equaling the cash at expiration. As carrying charges and other costs are subtracted from
the Futures contract on a daily basis, a continuous and gradual price erosion occurs during the life of the
contract.
Over a period of time, the inherent price distortion in a Futures market can wreak havoc with longterm wave analysis. In addition, some Futures markets (due to limited public participation) are
susceptible to intentional or accidental manipulation by "strong hands" (well capitalized individuals or
groups). Again, this can create great difficulty in deciphering an Elliott Wave pattern.
Cash Data (the proper data for the creation of wave charts)
Manipulation of a true cash market is far more difficult than a Futures market and requires much more
capital ( due to a lack of leverage) and time to initiate. Therefore, the return on investment is less when
attempting to manipulate a Cash market. Additionally, a Cash position is not as liquid as a Futures
position. The result, manipulation of a Cash market is seldom attempted or successful.
The Wave Theory requires a large degree of public involvement (which generally precludes or
greatly hinders any manipulation potential) to manifest itself. Since Cash markets always involve more
participation by the public (through direct buying and consumption, as is the case with commodities) than
Futures markets, wave formations always tend to be more standardized and predictable when cash data
is used. In constructing your data series, use cash data whenever possible.
Now, we need to deal with another matter which has to be broken up into three different discussions.
As mentioned earlier, proper analysis requires only one price data point occur per predetermined time
period. How is this data obtained or decided upon? The next three numerical divisions discuss that
problem:
1. For most Cash markets, there is no decision to be made; only a single price quote per day is
available. When only one data point per day is available, you simply plot that data over a predetermined,
consistent horizontal distance ("base" time unit) which represents one full trading day. Each new data
point will be plotted an equal distance from the next (this always applies no matter what time frame is
covered on the chart).
2. It becomes more difficult to deal with a Cash market which has data available continuously all
day (such as the S&P 500, NYSE, MAXI, Value Line, etc.). First, you need to decide which minimum
time frame you plan on following. The shorter the time frame, the more sophisticated the equipment and/
or software necessary to track the data and the more charts which will need plotting and deciphering.
Following shorter and shorter time frames for trading requires you have a progressively greater
understanding of the Wave Theory and a "warehouse" of memorized information at your disposal. The
shorter the time frame followed, the greater the likelihood one of the many important, but subtle factors
necessary for proper Wave analysis will be overlooked in the rush and excitement of the trading day. We
could call this the "Elliott time crunch;" everyone is subject to it, some more than others. Guard yourself
against the danger of trying to trade with the Theory over shorter periods of time than can possibly be
handled. If you do not, adverse and unexpected market action will cure you of the habit.
The greatest benefit of following a market on a short-term time frame (if you are holding positions
General Concepts 2-9
overnight) is it increases your ability to determine when a pattern has completed.* Personally, I usually
employ the intraday market action as part of my charting arsenal only when I am looking for a low risk
entry and price patterns indicate the end of a campaign is approaching.
As an analyst, traderor investor, you will need to decide which time frame is best suited to yourneeds.
If you decide one figure a day is all you would like to deal with, you are also deciding the type of move
you are interested in is one that lasts several weeks to a few months. You will not be able to day-trade
following only one figure per day, obviously. To arrive at one figure per day for a continuously traded
cash market, add the extreme (real) high and low together and divide by two (2). Plot as described in
"How Do You Plot Data," which immediately follows. If you want a little more daily detail by using
two figures a day, there are two choices. You can divide the day in two equal parts and take the average
of the high and low for each session !l[ you can use the high and low for the entire day and plot them in
the order they occurred (this last approach is the best). That is, if the high of the day came first, reserve
it for the first time slot of the two slot day and plot the low second (or vice versa).
There is a small problem with plotting real-higMow readings that are available for cash market
indices based on underlying stocks. Not all stocks open at the same time. The practice of most exchanges
is to calculate the opening from the few stocks which are open early in the morning with the previous
days closes of all stocks not open during early trading. This forces the cash market to always open
approximately where it closed the previous day even if the Futures price "gaps" at the opening. By using
averages, you basically eliminate any significant distortion created by this form of tabulating. Without
any adjustment, correctly using a cash Index's "real" higMow plot often exhibits horizontal price
movement ( during the opening period) even when the Futures market opens hundreds of points higher
or lower. The only way to avoid this situation is to drop the first 10 to 15 minutes of the trading day from
the recorded data, then calculate the high and low for the day. This way you are usually assured most
stocks are open and the openings (not the previous day's closes) are part of the current reading.
3. The last situation of concern when plotting data is in reference to 24-hour markets; markets not
just traded here in the U.S., but those which continue to trade around the clock on virtually every
exchange in the world. Currency markets are a perfect example of a situation. How do you properly keep
track of such markets?
Over a period of time, I experimented with plotting the cash markets of Gold, Silver, Australian $/
U.S.$ and the Swiss Franc/ Australian$ in different ways. When these markets were plotted using data
available only during the time they traded in one particular country (the U.S., London, or Australia), the
wave patterns were decipherable and followed typical Elliott patterns. Another approach was to equally
space the price action of a 24-hour market among the number of markets in which the product is traded
and plot that action in a continuous string. Another way is to separate the world into time zones of equal
amounts and place the price action of the important world market that falls into that time zone on the chart
*Determining when a pattern has completed, to most beginners, is perceived as picking top or bottom tick in a market and
is the assumed key to making money in the markets. Always trading with the in1'!l1 of only getting in at top or bottom tick
is a very dangerous habit and is not the way large amounts of money are made in this game. Profits can usually be made faster
and safer when entering right before a market's acceleration phase. This usually takes place well after the high or low in the
market has occurred. In addition, it is generally very important to let the market confirm (even if only in the smallest way)
a change in trend has occurred before entering a position. By demanding confirmation before entering a market, you can
almost always eliminate the possibility of getting caught on the wrong side of a "gap" opening. Also, if your atte~tion is s~ctly
focused on short-term orovemight trading, large patterns which have been forming for months or years can unwmd overnight,
creating panic "gap" openings. (A "gap" opening occurs when the market opens substan~ally higher or lo~er than the
previous day's close and usually indicates the opening is outside of the previous day's tradmg range.) The SIiver market
experienced one of these openings two days in a row in mid-April 1987. The "gap" was so larg_e on both days that the ~ark et
opened "up-the-limit"preventing anyone from exiting the market who was short from the preVIous day. Wrongly posmoned
in just one such situation can eliminate an entire year's worth of trading profits (assuming you had a profit to lose).
2-1 o General Concepts
in a continuous chain of events. The wave patterns under both of the last two approaches tended not to
conform to normal Elliott patterns and were quite often indecipherable. The only approach I have not
experimented with, that may work, is keeping track of an entire high/low range for all the world markets
per every 24-hour time period. The easiest way to do that would be to use the close of the market in your
country as the close of each 24-hour period. The minute YQ1!! country's market closes, the next trading
day begins. Just like the other markets which have a higMow range, instead of just one price per day,
you could average the range of the 24-hour time period or plot the high/low in order (in this situation
that might be difficult information to obtain).
Conclusion: From the above experiments, it was proven that each market should be followed in one
country only! Most people involved in a market get in and out of their positions using the same exchange;
this creates multiple closed-loop trading environments for each exchange ( and country). In essence, each
market, despite its similar name to another market traded in another country, is trading on its own internal
perception of the technical and fundamental factors which affect that market in the country of origin. This
indicates that as each trading day passes, each country is basically reliving the same market conditions
experienced by all the others during their trading day ( with minor variations, of course). After a period
of time has passed, the technical and fundamental conditions will exert themselves in such a way that
each market is poised to make a significant move in unison with all the others. Under these conditions,
it takes only one market to "start the ball rolling" and the rest follow suit as they open.
To get to the root of the problem, this is how 24-hour markets should be handled. Keep cash charts
on the market you follow, but only during the trading time of your particular country. If it is a very thinly
traded vehicle in your country, you may want to follow the cash price in a country where the currency
or commodity is more heavily traded and follow the Futures contract in that country.
For protection against a significant move which starts in another country, it is essential you have a·-
brokerage firm which provides an overnight trading desk. This will allow you to place orders to protect
against gap openings which may occur in the Futures market of your country. How does it work? The
overnight desk keeps tabs on trading as it circles the globe. When a market starts to move in another
country, any movement which hits your stop (with the overnight desk) will be activated immediately.
You will be out well before the move has had a chance to pick up steam and really cause damage by the
time the U.S. markets open. This basically eliminates the possibility of a market opening at a price much
worse than where you wanted to be stopped out.
In closing, because of the circumstances surrounding 24-hour markets, if you do not have a broker
who can provide you with a night desk to place overnight stops, it is strongly recommended you only
day-trade (no position held overnight) OR only intermediate to long-term trade the 24-hour markets.
Taking a position with the intent of only holding it overnight OR just for a few days (short-term) can be
very risky without the aid of an overnight desk.
How Do You Plot Data?

Once you have decided on the market you wish to follow and the data desired, it is necessary to choose
the time frame which will be employed on the chart. A properly plotted data series should be constructed
like Figure 2-6 (next page). This diagram shows one figure (represented by each dot) being placed in
the center of the time slot which the figure covers. After all figures have been plotted, use a straight line
to connect each dot. Monowaves will immediately begin to appear (see Figure 2-7, next page).

Normally, a minimum of three charts is necessary on each market followed; daily, weekly and

sizes and scales, including logarithmic plots of long-term data.
How Complicated Do Waves Get?
1111m1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
Until now, all discussions have been exclusively aimed atmonowaves. Monowaves, you remember,
are the simplest wave forms possible. More complicated patterns do of course occur. After you
understand how to analyze the monowave stage of market development (discussed in Chapter 3),
combining monowaves into groups (the purpose of Chapter 4) is the next step in the analysis process.
When combining three or five monowaves, you create what I have termed a Polywave, one level
above monowave development. When you combine three or five polywaves, you generally create a
Multiwave. Three or five multiwaves generally can be combined to create a Macrowave. This is the
highest level of development I have named. Anything above that level will continue to be referred to as
a Macrowave.
Remember, all smaller waves become part of larger patterns. This process continues indefinitely.
Therefore, as an answer to the question created by the heading of this section, there is no limit to how
large, time consuming or complicated an Elliott Wave pattern can get. Despite this fact, all market action
remains explainable within the limits of the Theory.
With most theories and techniques, it would be safe to say "as the time period covered increases, the
action in a market gets more difficult to decipher." On the contrary, due to increases in the certainty of
wave Structure for each segment of a large move, Elliott Wave can actually make long-tenn prediction
easier than short-term prediction.

The most important aspect of identifying Impulsive or Corrective monowaves is that it allows you
the ability to deduce the trend of a particular market. With a comprehensive understanding o.f all the rules
and factors which influence wave patterns, it is possible to predict the distance a move will travel and
approximately how long it will take. You can also accurately describe the psychological e~vironn:ent
which should unfold during the development of the predicted pattern. Even more useful and 1mpress1v~,
an accurate view of current action can frequently allow you to predict market action on a day-to-day basis
with precision accuracy. Finally, through the process of Compaction (explained in Chapter 7), you can
derive larger and larger trends to be taken advantage of.

Whether you are a novice or an advanced student of the Elliott Wave Theory, the meticulous study
of simple wave patterns is essential to accurate, long-term analysis. Monowaves, being the simplest price
action possible on a chart, are the obvious place for you to begin your observations. Unless you learn,
early on, how to indirectly categorize monowaves into one of the two classes (Impulsive or Corrective),
making progress with Elliott is extremely difficult. Let's start out by creating the proper charts. Afterward, we can proceed with the observations and quantitative mathematics necessary to decide whether
a monowave is representing an Impulsion or representing a Correction.

On your initial exposure to this material, you may simply want to follow the illustrations in the book.
After reviewing this section, it is recommended you construct your own real time charts as directed.
The first step in making a chart is to pick a market you wish to analyze and then decide on a starting
point for your observations. Without a specific starting point, none of the techniques to be described in
this chapter will make any sense. Here is what you do: plot a year of data consisting solely of the highest
and lowest price of each month in their order of occurrence ( using the techniques described earlier under
"WhatDataShouldBe Used To Analyze Waves,"page2-6and "How Do YouPlotData,"page2-ll ),
then look over that wave chart and locate the monthly monowave which is closest to the center of the
entire price range (high to low). [You want a staning point which is not of historical significance. Why?
Major turning points are more difficult to work with under Elliott since they are generally associated
with abnormal behavior. For our purposes we need to make things as simple as possible.] Next,
ascertain a date which falls around the price center of that middle, monthly monowave.
Once a date has been established, begin constructing your first daily wave chart (in the proper manner)
using approximately 60 cash data points covering about 8 inches of horizontal space on a sheet of graph
paper. On this scale, monowaves should be relatively easy to identify. After constructing your first chart,
pick the earliest important high or low that occurred ( see Figure 3-1 ). From that point you want to draw
Preliminary Analvsis 3-1
a second chart that doubles the detail of the first one ( Figure 3-2a starts from the important low marked
in Figure 3 -1; its time scale has been enlarged to allow for close scrutiny of monowaves ). In other words,
the same 8 inches of horizontal space used for the first chart will, on the second chart, cover only half
as much time as the first and employ approximately 30 data points.
Figure 3-1
In this example (Figure 3-1 ), an important low has been made around the center of the time period. From
that point a new chart was started (Figure 3-2a) that displays about half the time covered by the first chart.
I dentijication of M onowaves
After the proper charts have been completed, identifying each monowave becomes the next ste~ in
the analytical process. Using Figure 3-2a for demonstration purposes, start fr?m the lowes~ and e3:hest
point (designated "Important Low"). Follow the price action upward, data pomt by data pomt, u~nl ~ne
data point is lower than the previous, no matter how minor the amount. Once that change m pnce
direction occurs, you have just identified your first monowave. Put a DOT at the end of that initial
monowave (see Figure 3-2a).
Follow the down move from the dotted monowave's high (data point by data point). The first data
point that is higher than the previous indicates the market completed its second monowave. Put a dot
next to the secondmonowave's low (see Figure 3-2a). Continue this identification process until you have
dotted the end of numerous monowaves. In Figure 3-2b, all monowaves have been identified with their
own dot ( the end of the last mono wave is not dotted since a change in price direction has not occurred).

[In this example, the market has been advancing from an important low. Itcouldjust
as well have been declining from an important high; the same rules would apply.]
[Each change in price direction on the chart has
been identified with a dot. The dots mark the beginning and ending points of each monowave.
These extremes are subject to revision if any of
the price action comes under the jurisdiction of
the Rule of Neutrality (covered shortly). Once
the Rule is considered -and applied where appropriate - the position of the dots becomes final.]
Rule of Proportion (proper scaling of charts)
When you pick a particular price and time scale to plot a market, you are also simultaneously deciding
which Elliott Wave patterns will be visible and which will not. In other words, each pattern develops
based on its own, unique price/time scale. To detect and analyze a particular Elliott Wave pattern, your
chart must possess the correct proportions. The proper proportionality of market action is predicated on
the pattern developing. Adherence to the Rule of Proportion is essential to the accurate application of
the Rule of Neutrality (covered after this section) and to the standardized look of price patterns.
Prelimlnarv Analysis 3-3
The reason no single time scale will work for all analytical purposes is due to the flexible nature of
time. Just as Einstein's Theory of Relativity revealed, time is not absolute, but variable. In Einstein's
Theory, time was dependent on the velocity of the observer. Under Elliott Wave Theory (as it relates
to market action), time is dependent on mass psychology. Due to psychological influences, time expands
and contracts as the financial and economic hopes and fears of the masses are recorded through buying
and selling on an exchange floor. The reason no single price scale will work for all purposes is due to
the dynamic and fractal basis of price action under the Wave Theory. Price patterns develop
simultaneously on all dimensions large and small.
Before we can discuss the proportions of an ideal Elliott Wave chart, we must define the two ways
price action progresses through time; Directionally and Non-Directionally (this is not to be confused
with Impulsive and Corrective activity). Just like all Elliott patterns, if Directional or Non-Directional
action begins at a low, it will complete at a high and vice versa. Directional action is always composed
of a series of monowaves which, on the average and as a whole, create an increase or decrease in a
market's value (see Figure 3-3 below). As a general rule, the first monowave of a Directional period is
retraced no more than 61.8%. Directional action usually terminates when a monowave, traveling in the
direction of the Central Oscillation line, is retraced more than 100%. Non-Directional action is
composed of a series of mono waves which, on the average and as a whole, create stagnation of a market's
value (see Figure 3-4). The first monowave of a Non-Directional period is always retraced more than
61. 8%. Furthermore, all phases ( with the occasional exception of one phase) of Non-Directional action
must be retraced at least 61.8%. Non-Directional action usually terminates when price action moves
beyond the range of the entire Non-Directional period by a factor of 161.8% or more (see Figure 3-4).
To properly study a market using the Neely MethodofElliott Wave analysis ( discussed in this chapter
and throughout the book), you must strive to achieve a price-t9:time ratio which will produce an angle
of ascent or descent predicated on the type of market action unfolding. Irrespective of the price or time
consumed by a pattern, this angle should be implemented on charts ofimmediate analytical importance.

What is this specific angle of progression needed to view the Elliott Wave phenomenon? When
dealing with price action which is Directional, plot the data so it travels from the bottom left to top right
or top left to bottom right corner of a perfect square. In other words, the data should oscillate around an
angle which is approximately 45 degrees from start to finish (see Figure 3-5). This emphasizes the
important fact that the market dictates how charts should be constructed, thus eliminating the need to
subjectively deduce a charts' plotting parameters. This is not meant to suggest that every time the market
changes slope or direction, you throw away your current chart and start a new one. Continue to update

all previous charts, but begin a shorter-term chart at the point the market began a dramatically different
angle of progression. An example of this would be a shift from Directional to Non-Directional action
(or vice versa). Make use of your longer-term charts to help you identify these important changes.
Realize, when dealing with real-time data, it is not essential the angle of ascent or descent is exactly
45 degrees; some variance from ideal is allowed. Figure 3-6 illustrates the price and time range of error
which is allowed when you attempt to proportion a market's price action. As you can see from the chart,
a deviation of no more than 25% (vertically or horizontally) of the length of one side of the square should
be your charting goal. An example of a downward sloping Directional period can be found in Figure 3-
7. Notice the termination point is slightly to the right ofideal (late), but well within limits ofacceptability.
Figure 3-8 illustrates a Directional period which terminated a little to the left of ideal (early).

Bottom Right
The Directional price action within the Square progresses as it should, from the top left to bottom right
~. The pattern terminated a little late, but is
close enough to the bottom corner to say that the Rule
of Proportion has been obeyed. Now, the Elliott
Wave pattern within the square can be analyzed with
the knowledge that all important Elliott and Neely
Rules can be applied with confidence.
Figure 3-8
Early Termination (acceptable deviation)
The Directional price action within the Square progresses as it should,
from the bottom left to the top right corner. Termination of the pattern
1s close enough to the top corner to say that the Rule of Proportion was
obeyed. The Elliott Wave pattern within the square can now be analyzed
with the knowledge that all important Elliott and Neely Rules can be
applied with confidence and that the charts in the book should closely
resemble the real-time price action you are witnessing on your chart.

When analyzing price action which is Non-Directional, you want the up and down periods to cover
approximately half of a perfect square (see Figure 3-10). Notice how the Non-Directional action in
Figure 3-10 (Square A) terminates its horizontal period around the vertical 50% retracement point of
the square. Even when a Non-Directional period consumes a large amount of time and contains many
monowaves, the goal is the same (see Square B). Sometimes this goal may be impossible to obtain if
the pattern continuously contracts over a period of time. For those situations, make sure the furthest price
level from the beginning of the pattern falls around the 50% point (see Figure 3-11).
To synopsize, when it is time to construct a new chart, the Rule of Proportion directs you to design
the price and time scale to fit the requirements of the pattern forming. This will help your charts look
like those in this book, thus allowing for the most direct comparison and accurate analysis of the market
action. It will also prepare your chart's data for the possible application of the Rule of Neutrality.
Rule of Neutrality
After marking every change in price direction on your chart, you will find that most monowaves
travel at a diagonal to the price/time axis. Occasionally, you will find a monowave containing price
action which is progressing more horizontally than vertically. It is that type of behavior which comes
under the jurisdiction of the Rule of Neutrality. The Rule of Neutrality explains how to deal with these
problem monowaves and the dots which define their borders.
There are several areas of side ward price action which could come into question if we restudied Figure
3-2b, page 3-3 (reproduced below asFigure3-12). Those areas have been designated inFigure3-12 with
empty circles. We will spend some time later analyzing those areas. First, a detailed discussion of the
Rule of Neutrality - and how you should apply it to real-time - is necessary.

be "nearer to the horiwntal than to the vertical plane" have been circled and designated by the capital letters "RN" (Rule of
Neutrality). It is at these junctures that the
Rule of Neutrality should be considered.
Preliminarv Analvsis 3-9
Horizontal price action can separate two waves that are traveling in opposite (counter) directions
(see Figure 3-13a) or two waves that are moving in the same direction (see Figure 3-13b). To spotthese
two types of behavior and to make the Rule of Neutrality useful and applicable, the term "horizontal"
must be defined. Creating perfectly horizontal price action on a chart requires the same data point be
plotted twice in succession. Perfectly horizontal price action is not the only action which can qualify for
consideration under the Rule of Neutrality. The term "horizontal" describes price action which operates
within limits on either side of perfection; these specific limits are covered below.

price action
If you discover price action which appears to be moving more horizontal than vertical, apply the
following techniques. Draw a vertical (90°) and horizontal (0°) axis on your chart beginning from the
start of the suspected price action. Next, if the monowave is moving downward, draw a line from the
origin of the plane through the lower right quadrant (see left-hand side of Figures 3-14a and 3-14b); if
the monowave is moving upward, draw a line from the origin of the plane through the upper right
quadrant (see right-hand side of Figure 3-14a and of 3-14b). This will create a 45 degree angle to the
time (O") axis. The result is the separation of the quadrant into two equal parts. If price is moving
downward and is on or below the 45 (top left, Figure 3-14a and 3-14b) m: is moving upward and is
on or above the 45 ( top right, Figure 3-14a and 3-14b ), do not considerthe Rule ofNeutrality. If market
action is moving downward and is above the 45 (bottom left, Figure 3-14a or 3-14b) m: is moving
upward and is below the 45 (bottom right, Figure 3-14a or 3-14b ), the Rule should at least be considered.
The closer price action moves to the horizontal axis, the more likely the Rule will take effect.

Preliminary Analvsis 3-11
If price action indicates you should consider the Rule of Neutrality, it becomes necessary to observe
pre- and post-horizontal action to decide which Aspect of the Rule applies to the current situation. If the
horizontal price action separates two counter-directional monowaves, Aspect 1 of the Rule applies (see
Figure 3-15a). If the horizontal period separates two mono waves which are moving in the same direction,
Aspect 2 applies (see Figure 3-16). NOTE: An easy way to decide which Aspect of the Rule applies in
any situation is to count the number of empty circles required to encase the horizontal price action. If
only one circle is placed on the price action, Aspect-I (one) applies. If two empty circles must be drawn,
then Aspect-2 (two) is in effect (restudy Figure 3-12 [page 3-9] while considering this concept).
Aspect-1 allows for the termination of monowaves to occur above lows and below highs (Figure 3-
15a). Aspect-2, applicable only after the fact, allows the analyst to divide a single advancing or declining
phase (under the proper conditions) into three smaller segments (Figure 3-16). WARNING: Aspect1 should not be applied if the monowave, whose dot is being considered for transference, is retraced less
than 61.8% and then the market exceeds the end of said monowave (see Figure 3-15b).
In simpler terms, Aspect-I states that "when dealing with horizontal (or near-horizontal) price action
which separates two waves moving in opposite directions, resolve the first monowave to the far right,
at the termination of the horizontal price action." Aspect-2 states that "when horizontal (or near
horizontal) price action is found separating two waves moving in the same direction, the horizontal
action can be ignored, leaving just one larger monowave to contend with, or it may be employed to create
three smaller monowaves.

. Asrect-2 of the Rule ofNe~trality does not apply if the "horizontal" price action is actually counterdrrect1onal to the two same-direction waves it separates. The horizontal price action must drift in the
same general direction as the two waves it separates. For example, if the market begins moving upward
then hesitates for a time period, but no data point is lower than the last, and then the market begins to
advance again, Aspect-2 of the Rule may be used. If at any time a single data point is lower than the last,
Aspect-2 CANNOT be applied. WARNING: Anytime horizontal ( or near-horizontal) price action
consumes more than one time unit and separates two same-direction waves, Aspect-2 must be applied
to break the horizontal period into three segments.
Application of the Rule of Neutrality can, at times, be conditional. When a market contains horizontal
price action of only one time unit, the decision to apply Aspect-2 frequently rests with the relation of past
and future market action to the current. For example, if alternation of Intricacy is enhanced or Levels
of Complexity between patterns is improved or "missing" waves are eliminated by employing Aspect2, then it should be used. If use of the Rule actually creates these or other problems with standard pattern
formation, it should be ignored. If the termination of a monowave would occur beyond 38.2% from the
end of said monowave, do not apply Aspect-I (see explanation in Figure 3-17, below).
Until you have read most of this book and have come to understand the complex concepts discussed
in the previous paragraph which would prevent the use of Aspect-I or Aspect-2 of the Rule of Neutrality,
the best approach is to employ the Rule in a simplistic manner. If your chart is properly scaled according
to the Rule of Proportion (see page 3-3) and price action progresses at an angle less than 45 degrees
(upward or downward) from the horizontal and the Rule can be applied to the current situation, use it.
Ignore the Rule when "horizontal" action progresses at an angle greater than 45 degrees.
The previous Figure 3-12 (page 3-9) contained several "horizontal" periods which may require consideration under the Rule of Neutrality. Employing the concepts revealed in this section to those periods,
the horizontal action has been identified, discussed and finalized in Figure 3-17.
Figure 3-17
The angle of ascent at the
point marked is less than 45%
when the chart is properly
proportioned. But, based on
the percentage retracement of
the previous monowave
(which is greater than 38.2% ),
it is probably best to continue
tenninating it at the low.

Preliminary Analysis 3-13
Chronology
The numbering of monowaves is useful when discussing wave analysis with others over the phone
or through the mail as I do for my Telephone course and in my correspondent publication, "Wave Watch,"
respectively. The numbering of monowaves is not necessary if you have no plans of discussing your
wave interpretations with other people. When doing so, all monowaves which do not contain verified
Progress labels should be referred to by their Chronological number (i.e., Chronological I, Chronological 2, etc., or abbreviate them as Chrono-1, Chrono-2). To properly label each monowave, begin
numbering with the first monowave on the far left of your chart (see Figure 3-18). Notice the neutral
period (Chrono-13) has also been numbered prior to the decision to apply Aspect-2.
Figure 3-18

Rules of Observation ( determining relative position of monowaves)
All wave movement, no matter how large or small, must be classified into one of two categories:
Impulsive (:5) or Co"ective (:3). The term "Impulsive" defines action which moves in the direction of
the trend. "Corrective" represents price action which travels against the trend. For reasons which will
become clear later, the number ":5" is short for Impulsive action and ":3" is short for Corrective action.
These numerical representations ( or symbols) have been given the name Structure Labels and are useful
when beginning real-time chart analysis. [For a general description of Structure Labels, refer back to
page 2-5.] Some new analytical terms, techniques and Rules have been developed by the_authorto assist
you in the accurate placement of Structure Labels to real-time action even before you have a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies and complexities inherent in Elliott Wave Theory. These techniques will soon be applied to each of the monowaves recently identified in Figure 3-18. 1f you are
following along with your own chart, apply the same techniques in the order indicated.
Since monowaves have no indicative features, their Structure (:3 or :5) must be detected indirectly.
This is accomplished through the observation of preceding and proceeding market action. Obviously,
before you can actually begin the placement of Structure labels on price action, you must learn how to
3-14 Preliminary Analysis
associate preceding and proceeding market action to the monowave currently under analysis. The
presentation of these concepts will require what I call "relative perspective" diagrams.
Under all circumstances, the indirect analysis of monowaves depends on the relation of the "current"
monowave to surrounding monowaves. Whenever studying a chart, the monowave under analysis will
be considered mono wave number one ("ml," see Figure 3-19). The monowaves immediately after m 1

Future market action
contains m2 and additional waves It
Chosen monowave is mentany given the label
fill. When analysis of the chosen monowave
begins, it will be referred to as the monowave currently under analysis. Later, this will help
distinguish between past (mO), current (ml) and
future (m2) monowave development.
will consist of m2 and additional monowaves. The monowaves which occurred immediately before m 1
consist of mO and additional waves. Figure 3-19 illustrates how the choosing of any monowave on a chart
mentally creates the relative label "ml" for the chosen monowave.
Figure 3-20a presents the observations required to discover where m2 completed when m2 is a
monowave. Figure 3-20a also demonstrates the importance of breaking either the high or low of ml
before the finalization of rn2 can take place. Figure 3-20b presents a similar process which is used in
uncovering the termination of m0. These techniques will be used in the next section, "Retracement
Rules," to calculate the percentage relation of ml to m2, m0 to ml, mO to m2, etc.
In Figures 3-20a & 3-20b, m0 and m2 were monowaves. Unlike ml, which must be a monowave ( or
a compacted* Elliott wave pattern), m0 and m2 can be composed of one (or any odd number) of
monowaves, compacted or uncompacted. The composition of mO and m2 is dependent upon the amount
of market action that takes place within the confines of the high and low of ml. Using an upward slanting

Occasionally, when implementing the Retracement Rules (which follow this section) to determine the
internal Structure of a monowave, the study of monowaves other than m0 or m2 is necessary. Figure 22a,
above, demonstrates the Rules of Observation as they apply to monowaves which occur before m0 and
after m2. Careful study of the chart will demonstrate how to determine each monowaves' starting and
stopping points based on the high or low of the monowave before or after the current one.

Sometimes, breaking the high or low of ml (or any other monowave) requires the development of
more than one monowave. Figure 3-22b illustrates how m(-2), m(-1), m0, m2, m3 or m4 may be
composed of one or more monowaves. It is important to remember thatthe termination of all monowaves
to the right of ml must break a previous high or low; the termination of all monowaves to the left of
ml must be figured backwards in time based on when they "break" a latter high or low.
Preliminary Anatvsis 3-21
Before going any further with this chapter, it is imperative you understand the procedures necessary
in obtaining the terminal points of m(-2) through m4. If you do not feel comfortable with these
procedures, continue to study the Rules of Observation until you do; no additional work can be done until
this process is understood.
After you have become proficient at applying the Rules of Observation to actual market action, the
next analytical step involves the application oftheRetracement Rules. This will require calculating the
relationship of rn2 to ml and m0 to ml (on a percentage basis), then deciding which preestablished
relational range the calculated ratio falls within. The rn2/ml ratio describes which Rule Identifier
applies to "ml." Then, the m0/m 1 ratio indicates which alphabetic Condition of each Rule applies. Keep
in mind, the Retracement Rules work the same whether ml is slanting upward or downward.

WARNING: This section is.run intended to be read straight through. If this is your first reading,
skim through to grasp the general ideas, but do not spend much time on the details. The next time
you read this section, have your own chart handy and ready for analysis.
Once you have finalized the terminal points of all monowaves on your chart, you are ready to identify
the specific Retracement Rule which accurately describes the behavior of surrounding monowaves.
[NOTE: Your chart should never be so complicated that this process involves the identification of more
than 20 monowaves at any one time. For the best results (and the maintenance of your sanity), it is
recommended you apply the Rules in Chapter 3 to just a few monowaves of real-time action each day.]
To begin this process, pick the earliest monowave on your chart which you wish to analyze. That
monowave, as described earlier, should mentally be considered ml (monowave-1). Applying the Rules
of Observation discussed earlier (see page 3-14), measure the retracement of ml by rn2 -in percentage
terms- using the terminal points ( dots) of each. These measurements can be made accurately and swiftly
with the aid of a proportional divider set to a 61.8% ratio. Proportional dividers are available from most
engineering supply stores and are highly recommended for the purposes of this section. If you are
performing this procedure more precisely (and tediously) with the aid of an electronic calculator,
measure the vertical price coverage of rn2 and divide it by the vertical price coverage of ml. Multiply
the result by 100. The number remaining is the relationship of rn2 to ml in percentage terms.
Refer to the table at the top of the next page (titled RULE IDENTIFICATION); in that listing, locate
the relationship just calculated. That listing provides you with a Rule Identifier which represents
particular characteristics of current market behavior. Next, move forward to the heading which matches
your findings (i.e., Rule 1, Rule 2, etc.). Further clarification of the market environment is obtained by
calculating the m0/ml ratio. Measure the price coverage of m0, divide it by ml 's price coverage and
multiply the result by 100. Locate that percentage relationship under the "Conditions" section following
each Rule diagram and translate the m0/ml ratio into a Condition Identifier (lower case Arabic letter).
When working with Rule 4, you will also be asked for the relationship between rn2 and m3; this further
defines market action into Categories (Roman numerals). Finally, these Rules, Conditions and Categories will, in the "Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic" section, be transformed into Structure labels which
reveal the internal (unseen) make-up of the monowaves under analysis.
When you have decided which specific Rule applies to each situation, place those markings at the end
of m 1. Write it on your chart in pencil or photocopy the original and write on the copy. An even better
approach requires the use of plastic acetate placed over your chart and drawing on the acetate with a china
marker. When you place a Rule at the end of ml, abbreviate the Rule and its sub-sections to prevent
clutter on your chart (for example, Rule 4, Condition "a," Category "i" should be abbreviated R-4a-i).

3-24 Preliminary Analysis
Rule 3 (m2 is exactly 61.8% of ml)
An exact 61.8% retracement of ml by m2 (see Figure 3-25) establishes the dominance of Rule 3.
When market action activates Rule 3, the structure of ml is the most difficult to decipher since the
retracement of ml is right on the border line of indicating ml is more likely corrective or more likely
Impulsive. To further clarify the market environment surrounding ml, calculate the relationship of mO
to ml and find that relationship in the listing below to obtain a Condition Identifier for Rule 3.

When you have completed the Rule identification process for the current ml, move to the next
monowave in the sequence (which previously was m2), make that monowave the new ml and restart the
Rule identification process from that new point. If you have identified all of the monowaves on your chart
which you feel are important at this time, proceed to the "Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic" heading and
begin transforming the Rules at the end of each monowave into usable Structure labels.
Graphical Summary of Retracement Rules
After becoming familiar with the ideas presented in this section, the diagrams on the next two pages
should simplify the Rule and Condition identification process for you. To implement, first measure m2's
retracement of ml in percentage terms, then find that retracement value within one of the relational
ranges along m2's ray under the Rule Identification diagram (since m2 occurs after ml in time, m2's ray
extends to the right). Jot down the abbreviated Rule which is activated by that retracement range. Once
a Rule has been identified, the conditions which surround ml should be clarified. Move to the Condition
Identification diagram specifically designed for the Rule currently in effect. This time the ray will
represent m0 (the wave before ml), therefore it extends to the left. Locate the alphabetic Condition
associated with the relational value you measured between m0 and ml. Once this information has been
obtained, move to the section possessing the same name under the Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic.

Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic
lffllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I I II I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
The purpose of the "Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic" section is to provide Structure Labels to
replace the Rules you established earlier for each analyzed monowave. All Rules (including their
Condition Identifiers) are listed over the next 26 pages. Under each Rule are numerous paragraphs
separated into retracement values based on the length of mO, m2 or m3. These paragraphs query you on
circumstances unfolding in real-time on your chart. Based on your input regarding market conditions,
specific suggestions will be made on the most appropriate Structure Label(s) for each monowave and a
guess is usually made on the most likely Elliott pattern unfolding around ml. These Structure labels
indicate all possible locations a monowave can occur within an Elliott Wave pattern ( simple or complex).
Sometimes it is recommended a Structure label be surrounded by parentheses or brackets. If this situation
develops on your real-time chart, those Structure labels in brackets represent rare or extremely unlikely
possibilities. Structure labels surrounded by parentheses simply have a lower probability of being correct
than those which possess no encasement (i.e., no parentheses or no brackets).
3-32 Preliminary Analysis
To understand and make complete use of Chapter 3, at least a cursory knowledge of all chapters from
1 through 8 (inclusive) is required. If you are still in the early stages of your Elliott Wave learning curve,
many concepts and techniques (not as yet explained) will be suggested for use in this section which you
do not understand completely or have no working knowledge of. For this reason, become familiar with
these other chapters before attempting any analysis which is backed by capital investment. The Elliott
Wave Theory is such a maze of interlocking, interdependent concepts that an understanding of only
portions of the Theory is insufficient for accurate forecasting. The inherently complex nature of the
Wave Theory makes it impossible to confidently apply the prognosticative techniques discussed in this
section without some awareness of the general principles which guide wave pattern development.
After reading the book through the end of Chapter 8, return to Chapter 3 and begin the analysis
process; you will then be better equipped to understand and apply the ideas presented. For those still
becoming familiar with general Elliott Wave concepts, this section is designed to speed your learning
curve by providing you with expert counseling on Wave analysis until you become proficient at the
process. Furthermore, applying the Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic is a great way to learn of the
numerous observations and measurements required to properly dissect market action.
It is not recommended you begin your analytical "baptism of fire" by constructing a highly detailed
chart and attempting to analyze every wave. Construct a short-term chart and begin with the current day,
applying the rules one wave at a time and updating your chart and analysis regularly with daily data. This
approach will allow careful consideration of each Rule as it applies to specific situations. Applying the
Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic in this fashion should minimize the tedium ofrepetitious application
and the chances of analytical error possible when dealing with such extensive relational calculations.
WARNING: This section should NOT be read straight through. The instructions which follow
will only make sense, and be useful, when applied in conjunction with real-time market action. If
you currently do not have a chart to analyze or this is your first time reading this section, scan
through it then proceed to• and scan -the "Implementation of Position Indicators" (page 3-60).
Transformation of Rule Identifiers
The reliable application of Structure labels to replace Rule Identifiers usually requires the study of
price action before and after ml. If m 1 is the first monowave on your chart, there is no previous market
action to help you indirectly decide on the internal Structure of ml. Therefore, simply place the entire
Structure list, which appears immediately to the right of each new Rule section, at the end of this first
monowave. For example, to the right of Rule 1 (tum page to see listing) appears the Structure list ( :5/
(:c3)/(x:c3)/[:sL3]/[:s5]}. If ml is the first wave on your chart, place that entire list at the end of ml.
Ww:ninJ:: Do not apply these Rules to Compacted patterns which exceed their own beginning;
retain only the pattern's base Structure. Refer to the top of page 3-68 for a full discussion of this
concept. Figure 3-36 on the same page illustrates this behavior. If conditions on your chart are not
anticipated under the appropriate Rule section, please verify you are working with the correct Rule and
then make sure you reread the conditions necessary to activate that Rule. If ml is a monowave and you
still find there are no stipulations for the conditions on your chart, use the entire Structure list next to the
Rule heading of each section. If ml is a compacted polywave (or higher) pattern and you, again, find
no stipulations for the conditions on your chart, move on to the section entitled "Implementation of Position Indicators" (page 3-60) and use surrounding Structure labels to decide which Position Indicator
- if any - belongs in front of ml 's compacted Structure label (i.e., in front of ":3" or ":5").
Remember, all time and price calculations should be made from termination points (the dots used
earlier to identify the end of each wave); this applies whether working with monowaves or compacted
Preliminary Analysis 3-33
wave groups. If measurement is required to test the validity of a statement and the statement does not
specifically mention whether to measure price or time, price is always implied. Furthermore, do not take
these relationships so seriously that you eliminate a possibility just because a particular wave was 60%
ofml when it was supposed to be" atleast61.8% ofml." All specific ratios mentioned in this text (such
as 61.8%, 161.8%, etc.) must be given a slight range of error. When two patterns relate by 61.8%, that
means the smaller of the two may be anywhere from approximately 58% to 66% of the larger wave. This
provides about four ( 4) percent leeway either side of an ideal Fibonacci relationship. Finally, the phrase
"almost" and "close to" used throughout this section translate to "within 10% of the ratio mentioned."
For the same reasons that relationships between waves cannot always be expected to behave
perfectly, when following the guidelines listed in this section, if all conditions except one are scrupulously adhered to (and the one which is not followed is off by just a little), you should probably assume
the rules were correctly followed and place the suggested Structure label or list at the end of m 1. This
is all part of the Exception Rule discussed in Chapter 9, page 7.
On the other hand, time calculations which involve retracement of previous patterns must be taken
precisely as written. For example, many times throughout this section you will find something like this;
"if ml (plus one time unit) is retraced completely in the same amount of time that it took to form (or less),"
that statement must be taken literally. In this case, you would add one standard time unit (the time
consumed from one data point to the next) to the number of time units consumed by ml, then compare
that larger amount to the number of time units taken by m2 to completely retrace the length of ml. If
the two numbers are equal or if ml is a larger number, the statement above is true. If m2, after such
proceedings, is a larger number than ml, the statement above would be false.
The greatest technical and analytical value is derived from this section when the Rules are applied
to monowaves. When returning to this section for reassessment of a confirmed, Compacted Elliott
pattern, the primary purpose in applying the Rules is to detect the presence of "missing" waves. During
this reassessment, if none of the conditions listed (under the appropriate section) agree with the base
Structure of the compacted pattern, the compacted pattern might be missing a wave (page 12-34 discusses
this phenomenon). Encase those choices which do not agree with the base Structure of the compacted
pattern within squares. This provides you with a warning which should only be taken seriously if it is
later found that the compacted pattern cannot be adjoined acceptably to any surrounding monowaves or
wave groups. During reassessment, if you find that the Structure labels suggested by this section do not
allow you to connect the compacted pattern with surrounding price action, assume the pattern is part of
a Complex formation. If trying to reassess a compacted pattern and you find none of the conditions listed
under the appropriate section apply to the pattern, place all Structure labels listed next to the Rule heading
and encase those labels which disagree with the base Structure of the pattern within squares.
At the beginning of each Rule section, the chart used during the Rule Identification process earlier
has been duplicated for your convenience. It will probably help to glance at these diagrams as you read
the directions, comparing your real-time chart with the prescribed action. The first sentence of each of
the paragraphs to follow is the most important. If the conditions described in the first sentence are not
reflected in the actual market action, move on to the next paragraph (unless otherwise directed). If the
first sentence of a paragraph accurately describes the market action you are analyzing, always read the
rest of the entire paragraph. Some of the sentences which follow are very lengthy and contain many
conditions. Usually, all parameters enumerated in one sentence must be adhered to for the Structure list
to apply. Carefully read each sentence while comparing the statements to your chart and apply those
Structure labels to the end of those monowaves which it directs you to. Sometimes you will be trying
to analyze ml, but the section will direct you to place Structure or Progress labels or both at the end of
mO, m2 or other waves other than m 1; those directions are not misprints, place those labels as directed.

than m(-1) within a time frame equal to or less than that of m(-1), a Running Correction (any variation)
is probably unfolding; take note of that fact and add "[:c3]" after the ":5" already at the end of ml. If the
Running correction is a simple variation, it most likely started at the beginning of mO and concluded at
the end of m2 with ml the "b-wave" of the correction. For the Running Correction to be of the complex
Double Three variety, m(-2) must be shorter than m(-1 ); in that case, the formation probably started with

the formation probably started with m(-2) and concluded with m4 making ml the "x-wave" of the

Preliminarv Analvsis 3-35
If mO and m2 are approximately equal in price and time (or related by 61.8% in either case) and m3
is less than 161.8% of ml and m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time
(or less) that it took to form, ml may be part of a Complex Correction which will necessitate the use of
an "x-wave" Progress label. The x-wave would be in one of two places; the end of mO or hidden from
sight (i.e., invisible or "missing") in the center of ml. This concept of "missing waves" is discussed in
Chapter 12, page 12-34. To warn of these two possibilities, take a pencil and place an "x:c3?" at the end
of mO. Also, circle the centerof ml and, to the right of the circle, place "x:c3?," to the left place ":s5."
If m(-2) is longer than m(-1), the x-wave is not at the end of mO, drop that as a possibility. If the length
of m3 is less than 61.8% of ml, the probabilities increase dramatically that the x-wave is hidden in the
center of ml. These warnings will come in helpful as you group monowaves in Chapter 4 and as you
finalize your interpretation throughout the analysis process. If the x-wave is used, the previously placed
":5" Structure label applies.
If mO and m2 are obviously different from each other in price or time or both and mO and m2 do not
share any similar price range and ml, when compared to m(-1) and m3, is not the shortest of the three,
ml may be part of a larger Trending Impulse pattern; if so, the previously placed ":5" is used.
Condition "b" -- if mO is at least 61.8%, but less than 100% of ml
Place a ":5" at the end of ml. If the length of m(-1) is between 100-161.8% (inclusive) of mO and
m4 does not exceed the end of mO, ml may complete a Flat pattern within a Complex formation where
m2 is an x-wave; place ":s5" at the end of ml and "x:c3?" at the end of m2. Additional Structure labels
may be needed if certain behavior is exhibited by the price action. Read the below descriptions to decide
if any additional Structure labels should be added.
If mO is composed of more than three monowaves and ml (minus one time unit) retraces all of mO
in the same amount of time ( or less) mO took to form, mO might conclude an important Elliott pattern.
If part of m2's price range is shared by mO and m3 is longer and more vertical than ml during a time
span equal to (or less than) ml and m(-1) is longer than ml, add ":sL3" to ml's Structure list.
If part of m2's price range is shared by mO and m3 is longer and more vertical than ml during a time
span equal to ( or less than) ml and m(-1) is shorter than ml and mO and rn2 are obviously different in
price or time or both and m4 (or m4 through m6) returns to the beginning of ml in a time period 50%
of that consumed by ml through m3, a 5th Extension Terminal pattern may have completed with m3;
add ":c3" to ml 's Structure list.
If m3 is shorter than ml and part of rn2's price range is shared by mO and m(-1) is longer than mO
and ml, when compared to m(-1) and m3, is not the shortest of the three and from the end of m3, the
market returns to the beginning of ml ( or beyond) in a span of time which is 50% or less of that consumed
by m(-1) through m3; place ":c3" at the end of ml.
Condition"c" -- ifmO is between 100% and 161.8% of ml (inclusive)
Place a ":5" at the end of ml. Read the below descriptions to decide if any additional Structure labels
should be added.
IfmO and ml are approximately equal (allow for 10% leeway) in priceandmO and ml are equal or
related by 61.8 %. in time and m3 is longer and more vertical than m 1 and m2 takes at least as much time
as mO orml and m2 is very close to 38.2% of ml and one ofmO's Structure label choices is ":F3," then
add "[:c3]" to the Structure list for ml. For ":c3" to be a good choice, itis preferable m2 terminate at an
important Fibonacci price level to mO, ml or the previous Impulsive wave (monowave or higher). Keep
in mind that a ":c3," even under these conditions, is still a risky choice (that is the reason for the brackets
which surround it).
3-36 Preliminary Analysis
If m3 is longer and more vertical than ml and either m3 is completely retraced OR m3 is retraced
no more than 61.8% and m2 is very close to 38.2% of ml and one of mO's Structure label choices is ":c3"
and m(-3) is longer than m(-2) and m(-2) orm(-1) is longer than mO, ml may be the second-to-last leg
ofa Contracting Triangle; add "(:sL3)" to the Structure list. Keep in mind that an ":sL3," even underthese
ideal conditions, is still a less likely Structure label than the ":5" placed earlier (that is the reason for the
brackets which surround it).
Condition"d" -- if mO is more than 161.8% ofml
There is only one possibility under these circumstances, place a ":5" at the end of ml.

of the three is close to (or greater than) 161.8% of the next longest and m3 is retraced at least 61.8%, die
market may be forming an Impulse pattern with m 1 the center phase ( wave-3). For additional Structure
label possibilities which may pertain to ml, read the rest of this section.

If mO and m2 are related by 61.8% in price and equal or related (by 61.8%) in time and m(-1) is
161.8% or more of ml and m3 (and any additional monowaves required) achieves a price length longer
than m(-1) within a time frame equal to or less than m(-1), a Running Correction (any variation) is
probably unfolding; take note of that fact and add " [ :c3]" after the ":5" already at the end of m 1. The Running correction most likely started at the beginning of mO and concluded at the end of m2. When you
begin grouping your Structure labels in Chapter 4, work on the Running Correction as the first possibility
with the ":c3" either wave-b of a Running Correction or wave-x of a Double Three Running Correction.
Read on to be aware of additional circumstances possible at this juncture.
Preliminarv Analvsis 3-37
If m0 and m2 are approximately equal in time and m3 is less than 161.8% of ml and m(-1) is longer
than mO, ml might be part of a Complex Correction which will necessitate the use of an "x-wave"
Progress label. The~-wav~ will be inoneofthreeplaces; if m(-2) is shorterthanm(-1), thex-wave might
be at the end ofm0; 1f m41s no more than 161.8% of m3, the x-wave may be at the end of m2; or, ifmO
is_ no more th3:11 50% of ml and ml is the longest when compared to m(-1) and m3, the x-wave may be
h1dde~ from sight (i.e., invisible or missing) in the center of ml. To warn of the three possibilities, take
a p_enc!l and place an "x:c3?" at the end of m0, the end ofm2 and, if appropriate, the center of ml (using
a crrcle to mark the center of m 1 ). The "missing" x-wave in the centerof ml is the least likely of the three
choices under these circumstances. [The concept of "missing waves" is discussed in Chapter 12, page
!2-34.] NOTE: _The x-wave can occurin only one of the three places mentioned. If the x-wave concept
1s used at one pomt, erase the other two possibilities. These warnings will come in helpful as you group
monowaves together in Chapter 4 and as you finalize your interpretations throughout the analysis
process. The x-wave possibility makes use of the ":5" Structure label which should already be in place
at the end of ml.
If m(-1) is longer than mO and mO is shorter than ml and ml, when compared to m(-1) and m3, is
not the shortest of the three and m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of
time (or less) that it took to form, ml may be wave-3 of a Terminal Impulse pattern; place ":c3" at the
end of ml.
Condition "b" -- if mO is at least 38.2%, but less than 61.8% ofml
Place a ":5" at the end of ml, if m4 does not exceed the end of mO, ml may complete a Corrective
pattern within a Complex formation where m2 is an x-wave; place ":s5" at the end of ml and "x:c3?" at
the end of m2. Read through the rest of this section to see what other possibilities could be unfolding.
IfmOis composed of more than three monowaves and ml retraces all of mOin the same amount of
time ( or less) that mO took to form, m0 is probably the end of an important Elliott pattern.
If m0 and m2 are approximately equal in price and time ( or related by 61.8% in either case) and the
monowave before m0 is 161.8% or longer than ml and if m3 (and any additional monowaves that are
required) achieves a price length longer than m(-1) within a time frame equal to or less than m(-1 ), 1hm
a Running Correction (any variation) is probably unfolding; take note of that fact and add "[:c3]" after
the" :5" already at the end of ml. The Running correction would most likely start at the beginning of mO
and conclude at the end of m2. When you begin grouping your Structure labels in Chapter 4, work on
the Running Correction as the first possibility with the ":c3" either wave-b of a Running Correction or
wave-x of a Double Three Running Correction. Read the next paragraph to be aware of any additional
or unusual circumstances which could evolve under these conditions.
Ifm0 and m2 are approximately equal in price and time and m3 is not 161.8% (or more) ofml and
m3 (plus one time unit) is retraced completely by m4 faster than m3 took to form, ml may be part of a
complex correction which will necessitate the use of an "x-wave" Progress label. The x-wave will be
in one of three places; the end of m0, the end of m2 or hidden from sight (i.e., invisible or missing) in
the center of ml. [The concept of "missing waves" is discussed in Chapter 12, page 12-34.] To warn
of these three possibilities, take a pencil and place an "x:c3 ?" at the end of m0, the end of m2 and the center
of ml (using a circle to mark the center of ml). As the length of m3 drops below 61.8% of ml, the
probabilities increase dramatically that the x-wave (if it exists) is hidden in the center of ml. These
warnings will come in helpful as you group monowaves together in Chapter 4 and as you finalize your
interpretation throughout the analysis process.
If part of the pricerangeof m2 is shared by m0 and m0 and m2 differ by at least 61.8% in time and
if ml is not the shortest wave when compared to m3 and m(-1) and after m3, the market quickly returns
3-38 Preliminary Analysis
to the beginning of ml, there is a chance ml is an ":sL3" which is part of a Terminal pattern; jot down
that fact and add ":sL3" to the Structure list
Condition"c" -- if mO is at least 61.8%, but less than 100% of ml
Under all circumstances, place ":5" at the end of ml. If m4does not exceed the end of m0, ml may
complete a Flat pattern within a Complex formation where m2 is an x-wave; place ":s5" at the end of ml
and "x:c3 ?" at the end of m2. Other possibilities could be unfolding, read the rest of this section to make
sure no additional possibilities are missed. If the ":5" is used as the preferred Structure label, it may be
the end of a Zigzag within a Running or Irregular Failure Flat correction OR part of a Complex correction
where wave-xis at the end of m0 or m2 (add "x:c3?" to the end of m0). If considering the Complex
scenario, for the x-wave to work in the mO position, m(-2) must be shorterthan m(-1) and it is extremely
likely m(-4) would be larger than m(-3). Forthe x-wave to work in the m2 position, it is extremely likely
m(-2) would be longerthanm(-1). Furthermore, for the x-wave to work in the m2 position, ml must be
at least38.2% ofm(-1) with it preferable ml be 61.8% ormoreofm(-1). Record these facts and classify
them based on their proper Chronological label.
Ifm(-1) is larger than mO, but less than 261.8% ofml and m3 is shorter than ml and after m3, the
market quickly returns to the beginning of ml (or beyond), a Terminal may have completed with m3;
place ":c3" at the end of ml.
If m0 is composed of more than three monowaves and m 1 retraces all of m0 in the same amount of
time (or less) that mO took to form, mO probably ends an important Elliott pattern; note that on chart.
If m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (orless) that it took to
form and m3 is longer and more vertical than ml and m(-1) is not more than 161.8% ofml, a Running
Triangle may have terminated with m2; place ":sL3" at the end of ml. If the thrust out of the Triangle
(m3) is completely retraced by m4 faster than it took to form, the Triangle is of the Limiting variety. If
m3 is not completely retraced by m4 QRm4's slope is much less than m3's and m4 iscompletelyretraced,
the Triangle is probably of the Non-Limiting variety or m3 will become part of a five segment Terminal
formation.
If m3 and m(-1) are both at least 161.8% ofml, an Irregular Failure may have completed with m2;
place ":c3" at the end of ml.
Condition"d" -- if mO is between 100% and 161.8% ofml (inclusive)
If m2 takes the same amount of time ( or more) as m 1 QR m2 takes the same amount of time ( or more)
as m3, place a ":5" at the end of ml; other possibilities could be unfolding, read the rest of this section
to make sure no possibilities are overlooked.
Ifm2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
fonn and m3 is longer and more vertical than ml and mO and ml consume a similar amount of time
(within a 61.8% tolerance) and m2 is at least 61.8% of the time of m0 or ml and m0 is no more than
138.2% ofml, then a severe "C-Failure" Flat may have concluded with m2; place ":c3" attheendofml.
If m3 is longer and more vertical than ml and either m3 is completely retraced OR m3 is retraced
no more than 61.8% and one of mO's Structure label choices is ":c3" and in{-3) is longer than m(-2) and
m(-2) orm(-1) is longer than mO, ml may be the second-to-last leg of a Contracting Triangle; add "(:sL3)"
to the Structure list.
If m3 is shorter than ml and m3 is retraced at least 61.8% and ml takes less time than m0 and m2
takes just as much time (or more) as ml, then ml is probably part ofa Zigzag which concludes with m3;
put a ":5" at the end of ml.
Preliminary Analysis 3-39
Condition"e" -- ifmO is more than 161.8% ofml
No matter what the circumstances, a" :5" is a very likely Structure label for ml; place ":5" at the end
of ml. 1f m3 is shorter and less vertical than ml, the ":5" is the only plausible choice.
If m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m3 is longer and more vertical than m 1 and m(-1) does not share any similar price territory
with ml, the market may have completed a Complex Correction at m2 with a "missing" x-wave in the
middle of mO; add ":c3" to the current Structure list of ml, place a dot in the center of mO (around the
same price level ml completed) and place "x:c3?" to the right of the dot and ":5" to the left of the dot.

Ifm3 is more than 261.8% of ml, ml most likely is the center portion of a Running Correction, but
it could also be the end of a Zigzag within a Complex Correction; place ":c3/(:s5)" at the end of ml to
show these two possibilities respectively. Ifml is the longest when compared to m(-1) and m(-3) and
m2 breaks a trendline drawn across the low of m(-2} and mO in a period of time equal to or less than that

in their respective order. If ml is the longest when compared to mH) and m(-3) and m2 breaks a
trendline drawn across the low of m(-2) and mO in a period of time equal to or less than that taken by m I,
ml may be the 5th wave of a 5th Extension pattern; add [:LS] to the end of ml. If m(-1) is longer than
m3, drop ":c3" from the Structure list. If m(-1) is longer than ml, the ":s5" (if used for ml) could only
be the c-wave of a Zigzag within a Complex Correction; m2 would be an x-wave which is then most likely
followed by wave-a of a Contracting Triangle.
3-40 Preliminary Analysis
If m3 is at least 100 but less than 161.8% ofml, ml maybe the first leg of a Standard Elliott pattern
within a Complex Correction, wave-3 of an Impulse pattern with a 5th-wave Extension or the c-wave
of a Zigzag within an ongoing Complex Correction; place ":F3/:5/:s5" at the end of ml to show these
three possibilities respectively. lf ml is the longest when compared to m(-1) and m(-3) and m2 breaks
a trendline drawn across the low of m(-2} and mO in a period of time equal to or less than that taken by
ml, ml may be the 5th wave of a 5th Extension pattern; add [:LS] to the end ofml. Ifm4 is srnallerthan
m3, drop ":F3" from the Structure list. If mO simultaneously takes less time than m(-1) and ml, drop" :s5"
from the list. If m(-1) is longer than ml and the ":s5" is used, ml could 2llll: be the c-wave of a Zigzag
within a Complex Correction; m2 would be an x-wave.
If m3 is shorter than ml and m3 is completely retraced faster than it took to form, an Impulsive or
Complex Corrective pattern may have concluded with m3; place ":5/:F3" at the end of ml. If ml is the
longest when compared to m(-1) and m(-3) and m2 breaks a trendline drawn across the low of m( -2) and
mO in a period of time equal toor less than that taken by ml, ml may be the 5th wave of a 5th Extension
pattern; add [:LS] to the end ofml.
If m3 is shorter than ml and m3 is completely retraced slower than it took to form, ml concludes
a Zigzag which is part of a Complex Corrective pattern; place ":s5" at the end ofml. Ifml is the longest
when compared to m(-1) and m(-3) and m2 breaks a trendline drawn across the low of m(-2) and mO in
a period of time equal to or less than that taken by ml, m I may be the 5th wave ofa 5th Extension pattern;
add [:LS] to the end of ml.
If m3 is shorter than ml and m4 is shorter than m3, ml may have completed a Zigzag which is part
of a Complex Correctionorispartof a Terminal Impulse pattern; place ":s5/:F3" at the end of ml to show
these two possibilities, respectively. Ifml is the longest when compared to m(-1) and m(-3) and m2
breaks a trendline drawn across the low of m(-2) and mO in a period of time equal to or less than that taken
by ml, ml may be the 5th wave of a 5th Extension pattern; add [:L5] to the end ofml. If m5 is longer
than m3, drop ":F3" as a possible Structure label.
Condition "b" -- if mO is at least 38.2%, but less than 61.8% ofml
Ifm3 is more than 261.8% ofml, ml most likely is the center portion of an Irregular Failure, but it
could also be the end of a Zigzag within a Complex Correction; place ":c3/( :s5)" at the end of m 1 to show
these two possibilities respectively. Ifm(-1) is more than 161.8% ofml, drop ":s5" from the list. If
m(-1) is less than 61.8% of m3, more than one Elliott pattern may have completed at m2 ( each of a larger
magnitude).
Ifm3 is between 161.8 and 261 8% (inclusive) of ml, ml may be the center portion of an Irregular
Failure, the c-wave of a Zigzag within a Complex Correction or the center portion of a 5th Extension
Terminal Impulse pattern; place ":c3/:s5" at the end of ml. The Running Correction and Tenninal
Impulse both make use of the ":c3" while the ":s5" would be used for the Zigzag scenario. If m(-1) is
longer than ml, forget the Terminal scenario.
If m3 is at least 100 but less than 161.8% of ml, ml may be the first or last leg of a Zigzag within
a Complex Correction or the center portion of a 5th Extension Terminal Impulse pattern; place ":5/:s5/
:c3" at the end of ml. If m(-1) is longer than ml,drop ":c3" from the list of possibilities. If m(-1) is longer
than ml and the ":s5" is used for ml, ml would be wave-c of a Zigzag within a Complex Correction;
place "x:c3?" at the end of m2. If m4 is smaller than m3, drop ":5" from the Structure list. If m3 (plus
one time unit) is completely retraced faster than it took to form, drop ":s5" from the Structure list.
Preliminary Analysis 3-41
If m3 is shoner than ml and m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced faster than it took to form,
a Complex Correction may have concluded with m3; place ":5" at the end of ml. If m4 returns to the
beginning of m(-1) within a period of time equal to 50% ( or less) of that consumed by m(-1) through m3
and m(-1) is not more than 261.8% ofml, ml may be part of a Terminal Impulse pattern; add ":c3" to
ml.
If m3 is shorter than ml and m3 is completely retraced slower than it took to form, ml concludes
a Zigzag which is part of a Complex Corrective pattern; place ":s5" at the end of ml.
If m3 is shorter than ml and m4 is shorter than m3, ml may have completed a Zigzag which is part
of a Complex Correction or is part of a Terminal Impulse pattern; place" :s5/:F3" at the end of m 1 to show
these two possibilities, respectively. If m5 is longer than m3, drop ":F3" as a possible Structure label.
Condition "c" -- ifmO is at least 61.8%, but less than 100% of ml
If m3 is more than 261.8% of ml, m2 probably completed an Irregular Failure Flat or a Non-Limiting
Triangle; place ":c3/:sL3" at the end of ml. If m(-1) is more than 161.8% of ml, drop ":sL3" from the
list of Structure possibilities. If m(-1) is not more than 161.8% of ml and m(-2) is at least 61.8% of
m(-1), drop ":c3" from the Structure list.
Ifm3is between 161.8% and261 8% (inclusive) of ml, ml maybe the center portion of an Irregular
Failure Flat, the second-to-last leg of a Contracting Triangle or part of a Complex Correction; place ":F3/
:c3/:sL3/:s5" at the end of ml. If m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced faster than it took to form,
drop ":s5" from the above list. Ifm(-1) is more than 161.8% ofml, drop ":sL3" from the above list. If
m(-1) is not more than 161.8% ofml and m(-1) is retraced at least 61.8%, drop ":c3" from the above
list. If m4 is shorter than m3, drop ":F3" from the list.
If m3 is at least 100% but less than 161.8% of ml, ml may be the center portion of an Irregular Failure
Flat, the second-to-last leg of a Contracting Triangle, the center leg of a 5th Extension Terminal pattern
or one of the legs of a Complex Correction; place ":F3/:c3/:sL3/:s5" at the end of ml. If m4 is shorter
than m3, drop ":F3" from the list and forget about the Terminal scenario. If m3 (plus one time unit) is
completely retraced faster than it took to form, drop ":s5" from the above list. If m(-1) is more than
161.8% ofml, drop ":sL3" from the above list. Ifm(-1) is not more than 161.8% ofml and m(-1) is
retraced at least 61.8%, drop ":c3" from the above list.
If m3 is shorter than m 1 and m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced faster than it took to form,
a Terminal Impulse or Complex Correction may have concluded with m3; place ":c3/:F3" at the end of
ml. Ifm(-1) is less than 138.2% or more than 261.8% ofml, the ":c3" becomes very improbable; place
brackets around it - "[:c3]."
If m3 is shonerthan m 1 and m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced slower than it took to form,
m 1 may be wave-a of a Zigzag or the c-wave of a Zigzag within a Complex Correction; place ":F3/( :s5)"
at the end of ml. If m5 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced by m4 faster than m4 took to form,
drop "(:s5)" from the list.
If m3 is shoner than ml and m4 is shorter than m3, ml may be the last leg of a Zigzag or Flat within
a Complex Correction, one of the center legs of a Running Contracting Triangle OR the first leg of a
Terminal Impulse pattern; place ":s5/:c3/(:F3)" at the end of ml. If m5 is longer than m3, drop "(:F3)"
from the Structure list. If rn(-1) is longer than 261.8% of ml, drop ":s5" from the list.
Condition "d" -- if mO is at least 100%, but less than 161.8% of ml
If m3 is more than 261.8% of m2, ml may be the first leg ofa Zigzag, the center section ofa C-Failure
Flat or the second-to-last leg of a Triangle; place ":5/:c3/(:sL3)" at the end of ml. If m(-1) is less than
61.8% or more than 161.8% of mO, drop "(:sL3)" from the Structure list. If m2 is retraced slower than
it took to form, drop "(:sL3)" and ":c3" from the list. If m3 is more than 161.8% of ml, drop ":5" from
the list.
3-42 Preliminary Analysis
If m3 is between 161.8 and 261.8% (inclusive) of m2, ml may be the center section of a C-Failure
Flat, the second-to last leg of a Contracting Triangle or the first leg of a Zigzag; place ":dhL3/:5" at
the end of ml to show these three possibilities respectively. If m(-1) is less than 61.8% of mO OR more
than 161.8% of mO, then check to see if ml is less than 38.2% of m(-3) through mO; if so, drop ":sL3"
from the list; ifml is more than 38.2%, but less than 61.8% ofm(-3) through m(-1), place parentheses
around ":sL3" to show that, though it is possible, it is not the preferred choice. Ifm(-1) falls between
61.8-161.8% of mO, drop ":c3" from the list. If m4 is less than 61.8% of mO, place parentheses around
":5" to indicate its lower probability.
If m3 is at least 100 but less than 161.8% of m2, ml is probably the first leg of a Zigzag, but it may
bein a Triangle; place ":5/(:c3)/[:F3]" at the end of ml. Ifm4 is largerthan m3, drop "(:c3)" and "[:F3]"
from the list of possibilities. If m4 is shorter than m3 and m5 retraces m4 faster than m4 took to form
and m5 is equal to (or longer) and more vertical than ml, drop ":5" from the list.
Condition "e" -- if mO is between 161.8% and 261.8% ofml (inclusive)
If m3 is more than 261.8% of m2, m 1 may be the first leg ofa Zigzag, the center section ofa C-Failure
Flat which concludes a Complex Correction (with a "missing" x-wave in the middle of mO) or the secondto-last leg of a Triangle; place ":5/:c3/(:sL3)" at the end of ml. If m(-1) is less than 61.8% or more than
161.8% of mO, drop "(:sL3)" from the Structure list. If m2 is retraced slower than it took to form, drop
"(:sL3)" and ":c3" from the list. If m3 is more than 161.8% of ml, drop ":5" from the list.
If m3 is between 161.8 and261.8% (inclusive)of m2, ml may be the first legofaZigzagorthecenter
section of a C-Failure Flat which concludes a Complex Correction (with a "missing" x-wave in the
middleofmO); place ":5/:c3" at the end of ml and put a dot in the middle ofmO with "x:c3?" to the right
and ":s5?" to the left of the dot. If m2 is retraced slower than it took to form, drop ":c3" from the list.
If m3 is more than 161.8% of ml, drop ":5" from the list.
If m3 is at least 100, but less than 161.8% of m2, ml may be the first leg of a Zigzag or the first leg
of a Triangle; place ":5/(:F3)" at the end of ml. If m4 is a monowave and m4 is longer than m3, drop
"(:F3)" from the Structure list.
Condition ''f'' -- if mO is more than 261.8% of ml
If m3 is more than 261.8% of m2, ml may be the first leg of a Zigzag or the center section of a CFailure Flat which concludes a Complex Correction (with a "missing" x-wave in the middle of mO); place
":5/(:c3)" at the end of ml. If m2 is retraced slower than it took to form, drop ":c3" from the list. If m3
is more than 161.8% of ml, drop ":5" from the list. If the "(:c3)" Structure label is used for ml and
m(-1) shares no similar price territory with ml, mark the middle of mO with a dot and place "x:c3?" to
the right of it and ":s5" to the left of the dot to represent mO's "missing" x-wave possibility.
If m3 is between 161.8 and261.8% (inclusive) of m2, ml may be the first leg of aZigzagorthecenter

Category "i" -- ifm3 is at least 100%, but less than 161.8% of m2
If m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced slower than it took to form, ml should be the first
leg of a correction which follows an x-wave (mO) or the end of a corrective phase which is part of a larger
Standard or Non-Standard formation; place ":F3/:s5" at the end of ml. If ":F3" is chosen, ml is wavea of a Flat correction. If":s5" is appropriate, ml is the end of a Zigzag pattern. If ml is less than 61.8%
of m(-1 ), drop ":s5" from the Structure list. If mO simultaneously takes less time than m(-1) and ml, drop
":s5" from ml's list.
If m3 is completely retraced in the same amount oftime ( or less) that ittook to form, there is virtually
no chance ml completed an Elliott pattern; place only ":F3/:c3" at the end of ml. If ml is retraced no
more than 70% and none of m2's price range is shared by mO and m3 is almost 16L8% of ml and mO
takes more time than m(-1) m: mO takes more time than m 1, add ":s5" to the Structure list. If none of m2's
price range is shared by mO, drop ":c3" as a choice. If" :F3" is used, m 1 would be wave-a of a correction
within a larger complex formation; mO would be an x-wave. If" :c3" is still a possibility, ml may be part
of an Expanding Triangle or a Terminal Impulse pattern. If ":s5" is a possibility, it would be wave-3 of
a 5th Extension Impulse pattern.
If m3 is retraced less than 100%, place ":F3/:s5" at the end of ml. If m2 is composed of more than
three monowaves and m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced faster than it took to form and m2
takes more time than ml and m2 breaks a line draw across the end of m(-2) and mO faster than m 1 took
to form, then m 1 may be the end of a Zigzag contained within an Irregular or Running Correction; add
":L5" to the Structure list at the end of ml. The ":L5" in this case was justified based on the two stages
of confirmation possible when dealing with polywave patterns (see Chapter 6 for further details). If mO
simultaneously takes less time than m(-1) and ml, drop ":s5" from list. If ":F3" is chosen, ml is wavea of a Flat or Triangle correction. If ":s5" is appropriate, ml is the end of a Zigzag pattern.
Category "ii" --if m3 is between 161.8% and 261.8% ofm2 (inclusive)
If m(-1) is more than 261.8% of ml, there is virtually no chance ml is the end of any Elliott formation;
place Qill)'. ":F3" at the end of ml.
if m4 is longer than m3, it is extremely unlikely ml is the end of any Elliott pattern, place only ":F3"
at the end of ml.
If m3 is retraced less than 100%, place ":s5" at the end of ml then follow the below directions to
decide what type of Elliott pattern is forming.
1. Ifml isretracednomorethan 70%andml isfrom101-161.8%ofm(-l)andnoneoftheprice
range covered by m2 is shared by mO and m(-2) is longer than m(-1 ), ml may conclude the 3rd wave of
3-44 Preliminary Analysis
a Trending 5th Extension Impulse pattern. If ml is between 161 .8-261 .8% of m(-1), it becomes more
likely that ml is the end of a Zigzag inside of a Complex Correction with m2 the end of an "x-wave." But,
the 3rd wave idea is still possible as long as you identify the 3rd wave as part of a Double Extension
Impulse pattern (see diagram; Chapter 12,page 12) with the 5th wave the longest. If ml is more than
261 .8% of m(-1), the Complex corrective scenario is the only proper choice.
2. If ml is retraced no more than 70% and ml is at least 100, but less than 161.8% of m(-1 )and
some of the price range covered by m2 is shared by mO and m(-2) is longer than m(-1 ), then ml may
conclude the 3rd wave of a Terminal 5th Extension Impulse pattern. If ml is between 161.8-261.8%
(inclusive) of m(-1 ), it becomes more likely ml is the end of a Zigzag inside of a Complex Correction with
m2 the end of an "x-wave." But, the 3rd wave idea is still possible as long as you identify the 3rd wave
as part of a Double Extension Terminal Impulse pattern with the 5th wave the longest. If ml is more than
261.8% ofm(-1), the Complex Corrective scenario is the only proper choice.
3. lfml is retraced no more than 70% and ml is smaller than m(-1 ), ml can only be part of a
Zigzag pattern.
4. lfml is retraced more than 70%, it is most likely ml terminated a Zigzag. But, if the price
ranges of mO and m2 share some common territory and m3 is retraced faster than it took to form, ml
may be the 3rd wave of a 5th Extension Terminal Impulse pattern.
Make notes of these facts on your chart.
Category "iii" -- ifm3 is more than 261.8% of m2
If m(-1) is more than 261.8% of ml, there is virtually no chance m 1 is the end of any Elliott formation;
place mili'. ":F3" at the end of ml.
If m3 is retraced completely by m4, it is extremely unlikely ml is the end ofany Elliott pattern, place
only ":F3" at the end ofml.
If m3 is retraced less than 100%, it is extremely unlikely ml is the beginning of any Elliott pattern,

Preliminary Analvsis 3-45
If m3 is completely retraced slower than it took to form; place" :F3/:c3/:s5" at the end of ml. If the

Ifm3 is retraced less than 61.8%, it is extremely unlikely ml is the beginning of any Elliott pattern;

3-46 Preliminary Analysis
If neither of the conditions above applies, place ":F3/:c3/:sL3/:s5" at the end of ml. If the end of ml

Condition "c" { :c3/(:F3)/(x:c3)}
Category "i" -- ifm3 is at least 100%, but less than 161.8% of m2
The subtleties of this situation do not allow for specific quantifications, just place an ":F3/:c3" at the
end of ml. If the end of ml is exceeded during the formation of m2, add an "x" in front of ":c3." The
interaction of ml with surrounding Structure will help to decide which of the two Structure labels best
fits current conditions.
Category "ii" -- if m3 is between 161.8% and 261.8% ofm2 (inclusive)
If m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m3 is more than 161.8% ofml, the chances are better that ml was the center section of a CF ailure Flat orof a Contracting Triangle; place ti :c3/( :F3) ti at the end of m 1. If the end of m I is exceeded
during the formation ofm2, add an "x" in front of ":c3." If the lower probability "(:F3)" is correct, ml
is part of an Elongated Flat.
Under all other situations, place ":F3/:c3/x:c3" at the end of ml.
Category "iii" -- if m3 is more than 261.8% of m2
If m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form, it is almost certain ml is the center section of a C-Failure Flat or a Non-Limiting, Contracting
Triangle; place ":c3/[:F3]" at the end of ml. If the end of ml is exceeded during the formation of m2,
add an "x" in front of ":c3." The only way "[:F3]" should be considered is if m3 is retraced more than
61.8% within a period of time equal to or less than m3.

of ml in price within the same amount of time (or less) as ml, ml may be part of a complex correction
in which mO contains a "missing" x-wave toward its center; place ":F3/[:c3]" at the end of ml and mark
(with a pencil) the center of mO with a circle and place "x:c3?" to the right of it, "c:5?" to the left of it
and ":F3?" at the end ofmO. All of the labels with question marks are interdependent; if one is used all
must be used, if one is not used, none of them can be used.
3-48 Preliminary Analysis
If m2 is completely retraced slower than it took to form, a Flat or Triangle is probably
involved; place ":F3/:c3" at the end of ml. If the end of ml is exceeded during the formation of m2,
add an "x" in front of ":c3."
If m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form, ":F3" is the only reasonable choice for ml.
Ifm3 is retraced at least 61.8%, but less than 100%, ":F3" is the only reasonable choice for ml.
If m3 is retraced less than 61.8%, place ":F3" at the end of ml. If m5 is not the longest when compared
with m 1 and m3 and m5 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time ( or less)
that it took to form, ml may be part of a Terminal pattern. If m5 is longer than ml and m3, ml may be
part of a Complex Double Flat pattern in which m4 is an x-wave. Make note of these possibilities. Under
both conditions listed in this paragraph, ml would be marked with an ":F3."
Category "iii" -- if m3 is more than 261.8% of m2
If m3 takes the same amount of time ( or less) as ml and m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced
in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to form, there is a strong possibility of a "missing" xwave hidden toward the middle ofmO; place ":c3" at the end ofml. If the end ofml is exceeded during
the formation of m2, add an "x" in front of the ":c3" at the end of ml. If m3 is retraced at least 61.8%,
it is possible ml is the first leg of a Flat; add ":F3" to the end of ml.
Ifm3 takes more time than ml, place ":F3/:c3" at the end of ml. If the end of ml is exceeded during
the formation of m2, add an "x" in front of ":c3."

Ifm3 is not more than 161.8% ofm2 and m3 is not completely retraced and m4 is retraced faster
than it took to form, ml could be the x-wave of a complex correction; add "x:c3" to the end of ml. In
this scenario, ifm(-1) is more than 61.8% ofmO, mO would be missing an x-wave toward its center.
Preliminarv Analysis 3-49
If m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m(-1) is not more than 61.8% of mO and m3 is retraced no more than 61.8% and m3 (orm3
through m5) achieved a price distance equal to ml (or more) within the same amount of time (or less)
as ml, ml may be part of a Complex Correction in which mO contains a "missing" x-wave toward its
center or ml is the x-wave after a Zigzag; place ":F3/[ :c3]" at the end of ml and mark (with a pencil) the
centerof mO with a dot and place "x:c3 ?" to the right and ":s5" to the left ofit. If the end of ml is exceeded

If m2 is retraced slower than it took to form, a Flat or Triangle is probably involved; place an ":F3"
at the end of ml.
If mO is a polywave (or a monowave with a suspected "missing" wave toward its center), ml may
be an x-wave of a Complex Correction; add "x:c3" to any existing Structure labels at the end of ml.
Ifm(-1) is no more than 61.8% ofmO, ml may be an x-wave ofa Complex Correction; add "x:c3"
to any existing Structure labels at the end of m 1.
Category "iii" -- if m.3 is more than 261.8% of m2
If m3 takes no more time than ml and m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same
amount of time (or less) that it took to form, there is a strong possibility of a "missing" x-wave hidden
toward the middle of mO; put an "x:c3" next to the termination of ml. If m3 through m5 fail to exceed
the beginning of mO and m3 is retraced at least 61.8%, it is also very possible ml is the first leg of an
Elongated Flat; add ":F3" to the end ofml.

Condition "a" -- mO is less than 100% of ml
**(if m2 is composed of more than three monowaves [or monowave groups])
If the first three monowaves of m2 W!.D.21retrace more than 61.8% of m 1, a Complex Correction may
be unfolding with the first or second monowave (immediately afterthe end of m 1) moving in the opposite
direction of ml representing an x-wave OR ml contains a "missing" x-wave or "missing" b-wave in its
center OR ml is the 3rd-wave of an 5th-Failure Impulse pattern (Trending or Terminal); place ":5/:s5"
at the end of ml. Add ":F3" to the end of ml if ml is retraced at least 25% by the first 3 monowaves.
NOTE: if the "missing" x-wave is used, circle the center of ml and place ":5 ?" to the left of the circle
and "x:c3 ?" to the right of the circle. If the "missing" b-wave is used, circle the center of ml and place
":5 ?" to the left of the circle and "b:F3 ?" to the right of the circle. If the b-wave is used, the termination
of the Complex Correction will be confirmed immediately before the point where the market violently
turns (in the opposite direction of ml) and exceeds the 61.8% retracement level of ml.
If the first three monowaves ofm2 retrace more than 61.8% of ml, ml may have completed wavea of a Flat with a complex b-wave OR ml may have completed wave-3 of a 5th Failure Impulse pattern;
place ":F3/:5" at the end of ml to show these two possibilities respectively.
**(if m2 is composed of three monowaves [or monowave groups] or less)
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time ( or less) that it took to
form and m(-2) and mOdo not share any similar price territory and m2 is larger than m(-2) and m(-2)
and mO are obviously different in price or time or both and when the price lengths of m(-3), m(-1) and
ml are compared, m(-1) is not the shortest, a Trending Impulse pattern may have concluded with ml;
place ":L5" at the end of ml.
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m2 is longer than m(-2) and m(-4) is longer than m(-3), a Zigzag or Flat may have concluded
with ml; place ":L5" at the end ofml.
Ifml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m2 is longer than m(-2) and m(-3) is longer than m(-2) and m(-4) is shorter than m(-3), ml
may be the end of a Standard Elliott pattern which is part of a Complex Correction where m(-2) is an xwave; place ":L5" at the end of ml and "x:c3?" at the end of m(-2). In the above situation, if m(-1) is
at least 161.8% of mO, the Standard Correction unfolding is probably a Zigzag. If m(-1) is at least 100%,
but less than 161.8% ofmO, the Standard Correction is probably a Flat.
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m2 is smaller than m(-2), a Flat or Zigzag may have concluded with ml; place ":L5" at the end
ofml.
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
fonn and m(-2) is smaller than m(-1) and m(-1) is not the shortest when compared to m(-3) and m 1 and
m2 is not retraced more than 61.8% and the market approaches (or exceeds) the beginning of m(-3)
within a time period which is 50% or less of that consumed by m(-3) through ml and the end of ml is
not exceeded for a period which is four times as long as !}lat co_nsumed by m(-3) through ml and m2-
m4's price coverage is at least twice that of ml and one of m(-l)'s possible Structure labels is ":c3," a
Termina/Impulse may have completed at the end of ml; add ":L3" to the current Structure list for ml.
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m3 is between 61.8-100% of ml, ml may be part of an Irregular Failure Flat; place ":F3" at
the end of ml.
Preliminary Analvsis 3-51
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m3 is longer than m2 and mO is at least 161.8% of m2 and m3 is completely retraced in the
same amount of time (or less) that it took to form, ml may be part of an Irregular Flat; place ":F3" at the
end ofml.
Ifml is completely retraced slower than it took to form and m2 did not retrace more than 61.8% of
the distance from the beginning ofm(-1) to the end ofml and m3 is shorter than m2, the market may
be cm1cluding a Complex Correction in which ml will be the most extreme price obtained by the market
for a period at least twice that of the combined times of mO-m2; place an ":F3" at the end of ml.
If m 1 is completely retraced slower than ittook to form and m3 is longer than m2 and m2 is not more
than 61.8% of the price dist;ince from the beginning of m(-1) to the end of ml, mm the market could be
forming a Complex Correction (where ml would be the end of one corrective phase of the pattern and
m2 would probably be the end of an x-wave) or an Expanding Triangle; place ":F3/:c3/:L5" at the end
ofml.
If ml is completely retraced slower than it took to form and m2 is smaller than m(-2), a Zigzag (which
is part of a Contracting Triangle) may have concluded with ml; ":L5" at the end of ml.
Ifml is completely retraced slower than it took to form and m(-1) 1s at least 61.8% ofml and m3
is smaller than m2 and m3 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same ,1mount of time ( or
less) that it took to form, ml may be part of a Flat which concludes a larger pattern; plac~ ": F3" at the
end ofml.
If m3 is longer than m2 and m4 is longerthan m3 and mO is less than 61.8% of ml, ml may have
begun an Expanding Triangle; add "(:F3)" to the Structure list at the end of ml.
If m3 is longer than m2 and m4 is longer than m3 and mO is between 61.8-100% of ml, the market
may be forming an Expanding Triangle; add "(:c3)" to ml.
Condition "b" -- mO is at least 100%, but less than 161.8% ofml
Ifm3 is longer than m2 and mO is closer to 100% than to 161.8% ofml, place ":c3" at the end of
ml. If m(-1) is longer than mO and the ":c3" is used as the preferred Structure choice, add "b" in front
of ":c3" to get "b:c3." This means that ml is the b-wave of a Flat correction. If m(-1) is less than mO,
ml may be the x-wave of a Complex correction, add "x" in front of the ":c3" instead.
Ifm3 is longerthan m2and mOiscloserto 161.8% ofml than to 100% ofml, place ":F3" at the end
of ml. If m(-1) is longer than mO, m2 is probably the end of a Zigzag. If m(-1) is shorter than mO, ml
may be an x-wave of a Complex Correction which ends with m4. To show these two possibilities
respectively, add "b:c3" and "x:c3" to the Structure list at the end of ml.
If m3 is at least 61.8% of ml and m3 completes without any part of it exceeding the end of m2 and
m2 is close to 61.8% of mO, ml may bethefirstlegof an Irregular Failure Flat; add ":F3" toml'sStructure
list if it is not already present.
If m2 is retraced less than 100% and m3 is atleast61.8% ofml and m3 completes without any part
of it exceeding the end of m2, place ":F3" at the end of ml.
Ifm2 is retraced less than 61.8% and ml and m3 share some of the same price range and m4 is no
more than 261.8% of m2 and m2 is not the shortest wave when compared with mO and m4 and m4 (plus
one time unit) is completely retraced faster than it took to form with the market approaching (or
exceeding) the beginning of mO in 50% of the time ( or less) that it took to form mO through m4, then the
market possibly completed a Terminal pattern at m4; place ":c3" at the end of ml (if ":F3" is one of m 1 's
current Structt:re possibilities, add brackets"[]'' around it to indicate ":c3" is a much better choice).

Labels at the beginning of this section at the end of ml. If none of the above conditions fit your current

If the first three monowaves of m2 retrace more than 61.8% of ml, ml may have completed wavea of a Flat with a complex b-wave OR ml may have completed wave-3 of a 5th Failure Impulse pattern;

**(ifm2 is composed of three monowaves [or monowave groups] or less)
Ifm2 is retraced less than 61.8% by m3, place ":L5" at the end ofml. Ifm0 and m(-2) share some

If m2 is retraced 61.8% or more by m3, place ":L5" at the end of ml.
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to

If ml is completely retraced slower than it took to form and m2 does not exceed the end of m(-2)

Preliminary Analvsis 3-55
Ifml takes the same amount of time (or more) as mOw:ml takes the same amount of time (or more)
as m2 and mO is close to 161.8% of ml, ml may be part of a Zigzag or Impulse pattern, place ":F3" at
the end of ml.

took to form and m2 is retraced less than 61.8 % OR more than 100% in a period of time equal to ( or less)
than that taken by m2 and m(-1) is at least 61.8% ofml in price and time and ifml is a Compacted
pattern, make sure no l2l!!1 of ml moved beyond the beginning of ml during ml 's formation, then there
is a chance ml completed the C-wave of a Flat; place ":LS" at the end of ml to show this possibility.
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced by m2 in the same amount of time ml took to form
(or less) and m2 is retraced less than 61.8% and m(-1) is at least 61.8% of mO in price and time, there
is a chance ml completed a Contracting Triangle or one of several Flat variations [depending on the
length of m(-1)]; place ":L3/:L5" at the end of ml to show these two possibilities (respectively). If ml
is a polywave and tmn of ml exceeds ml 's beginning, drop ":LS" as a possibility.
If ml is completely retraced slower than it took to form and m2 is composed of three or more
monowaves and m2 is longer than both m(-1) and mO, then ml may be one of the middle legs of a
Triangle; place ":c3" at the end of ml.
If m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and mO, when compared to m(-2) and m2, is not the shortest of the three and the market approaches
(or exceeds) the beginning of m(-2) in a period of time 50% (or less) of thattaken by m(-2) through m2,
a Terminal pattern may have concluded with m2; add ":sL3" to any current Structure list present at the
end ofml.
If m3 is between 101 %-161.8% of m2, an Expanding Triangle may be forming; if there is an ":F3"
in ml 's Structure list, add brackets around it to indicate ":c3" is the better choice.
Condition "c" -- mO is between 161.8% and 261.8% of ml (inclusive)
Despite any particular circumstances, ":F3" is a good possibility; place ":F3" at the end of ml.
If ml (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to
form and m2 is retraced less than 61.8% and during a period equal to the time of mO, m2 exceeded the
length of mO and m(-1) is between 61.8-161.8% of mO and m2's price coverage is larger and its
movement more vertical than that exhibited by mO, ml may have completed a Contracting Triangle QI
a severe C-Failure Flat; place ":L3/( :LS)" at the end of m 1 to show these two possibilities (respectively).
If m2 (plus one time unit) is completely retraced in the same amount of time (or less) that it took to

is not the shortest of the three and the market approaches ( or exceeds) the beginning of m(-2) in a period
of time 50% (or less) of that taken by m(-2) through m2, then a Terminal pattern may have concluded
with m2; add ":sL3" to the end ofml.
If rn3 is between 101 %-161.8% of m2, there is the unlikely possibility that an Expanding Triangle
is forming; add "(:c3)" to the Structure list.
Condition "d" -- mO is more than 261.8% of ml
If mO (minus one time unit) is less than or equal to ml in time OR if m2 (minus one time unit) is less
than or equal to ml in time, and as long as ml is not simultaneously less in time than both mO and m2,
ml is either the first phase of a larger correction or the completion of a correction within a Zigzag or
Impulse pattern; place ":F3" at the end of ml.
If m2 is retraced less than 61.8% and the combined time of m2 through m4 is equal to or less than
that consumed by mO and m2-m4's combined price coverage is larger and their movement more vertical
than that exhibited by mO, there is a small chance that ml completed a Contracting Triangle or a severe
C-Failure Flat; place "(:L3)/[:L5]" at the end ofml to show these two possibilities (respectively).

If m(-2) through m2constitute a Complex Correction with a "missing" x-wave, the market should retrace
between 61.8-100% of it before the next wave group (of the same Degree as the Complex Correction)

Implementation of Position Indicators
(Rules to reduce Structure lists to a single possibility)
Position Indicators are the alphabetic companions ("c, F, L, s or sL") which precede most Structure
Labels (:3's and :5's). Position Indicators do just what their name implies, they describe - sometimes
generally, sometimes specifically - the position of a Structure Label within the context of surrounding
market action. Since two varieties of Structure labels exist (those that contain Position Indicators and
those that do not), specific phrases representing each variety have to be coined to allow for accurate and
intelligible coverage of this subject. The phrase, "base Structure label," describes a Structure label which
is not preceded by a Position Indicator (i.e., solely a ":3" or a ":5" is present). A Structure label which
~ preceded by a Position Indicator (i.e., :F3, :c3, :s5, :L5, etc.) will be termed a "positioned Structure
label." In the paragraphs to follow, if the Structure of a pattern is not important, is unknown or bares no
significance to the discussion, the truncated phrase, "Structure Label," will be used to encompass both
possibilities.
The Position Rules must be used whenever there are wave segments which contain~ Structure
label possibilities. The use of Position Indicators is the only way novice Elliotticians can properly piece
together reliable Wave patterns. Surprisingly, this same approach is used by expert Elliott Wave
analysts, but most have internalized the process (through practice) to the point that they do not realize
they are applying these concepts; they probably do not even realize they are applying Elliott Wave
techniques in a standardized fashion - the same approach presented in this book.
The implementation of Position Indicators begins to intensify the bonds between adjacent wave
segments due to rules which guide Position Indicator coexistence. They begin to exert a degree of order
to the seemingly random fluctuations of market action. Position Indicators are the the next clarifying step
toward unraveling current market action.
If you find a wave on your chart which possesses multiple Structure label choices, the Position
Indicators will be needed to simplify your choices. These Indicators will assist you in eliminating all but
one Structure choice from ml 's list. Once all waves on your chart possess only one Structure label, later
in this chapter you will learn how to use these Structure labels to isolate important beginning and ending
points of Elliott patterns. For those of you who have had difficulty in the past deciding where to start
your analysis, this section will be the answer to your prayers.
3-60 Preliminary Analysis
Directions
By the time you reach this section, the internal Structure of numerous monowaves on your chart
should have been established. Unfortunately, the "Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic" are not always
capable of reducing the Structure choices of each wave to a single possibility. Therefore, it is likely
several waves on your chart contain two or more Structure labels. Studying each Position Indicator's
unique characteristics (described in this section) and logically integrating that label's implications with
surrounding Structure should enable you to eliminate all but one label from each wave segment.
Each Structure label in the listing to follow is separated by either a dash("-") ortwo plus signs("++").
All Structure labels connected with a dash are part of the same, Standard Elliott Wave pattern. If
separated by double plus signs, a completed Standard pattern occurred right before the double plus signs
and another Standard pattern begins right after the second set of double plus signs. The action isolated
between the double plus signs constitutes an "x-wave." Explained in detail later, "x-waves" connect
multiple Standard Corrections to form one larger Complex Correction (a Non-Standard formation). For
a detailed explanation of Standard and Non-Standard patterns, refer to Chapter 8.
Under the sub-heading, "Position Indicator Definitions and Sequences," are descriptions of all
Positioned Structure Labels. Knowledge of the characteristics of each Position Indicator is valuable
when attempting to reduce a monowave's listing to one possibility. Acquaint yourself with these descriptions so you can quickly spot and eliminate illogical Structure possibilities. ll2.ru!.t eliminate positioned
Structure labels ( which are connected to question marks "?") or base Structure labels ( which are the result
of compaction) unless they are within the confines of a larger Compacted pattern.
If a Position Indicator's definition does not allow you to reduce a monowave's Structure list to a single
possibility, below each label is a list of acceptable "before and after" Structure labels which can be found
in partnership with the current label being analyzed. Tthe left-hand sequences usually start with
corrective variations (:3's). The right-hand sequences usually begin with Impulsive variations (:S's). The
darkened, larger positioned Structure label toward the middle of each sequence represents ml. Taking
note of the Structure choices surrounding ml and comparing them with allowable "before and after"
possibilities on your chart, you should be able to eliminate improper Structure labels for all current ml 's,
leaving just one Structure label per wave. Keep in mind, once a pattern is compacted, its base Structure
label (:3 or :5) instead ofits positioned Structure label (such as :c3, :sL3, :s5, etc.) may be needed to create
Complex Elliott Corrections. This is another reason to retain base Structure labels on a compacted wave
group even after positioned Structure labels have been assigned to the pattern.
Position Indicator Definitions and Sequences
":F3"
This Structure label is the abbreviation for "First three(3)." An ":F3" either starts a series, occurs after
an "x:c3" or is found between two ":S's" (all variations). If you find two ":F3's" next to each other, a new
pattern (of a smaller magnitude) begins with the second ":F3." Circle the start of both ":F3's," but do not
attempt to connect the two until the second ":F3" can become part of a polywave pattern using waves
which proceed it (a polywave is an Elliott pattern composed of three or more monowaves). Examples
of where an ":F3" can be found under real-time conditions follow:
1. ? - F3 c3 - L5 (circle start ofF3) 5. 5 -F3 - 5 - F3 - L5 (second 5 at least 38.2% of first 5)

":c3"
This Structure label is the abbreviation for "center three(3)." A ":c3" can never start or end a
sequence; as a result, a large violent move will virtually never occur after" :c3." If the first wave in a group
contains more than one Structure label, and one of those happens to be a ":c3," you can eliminate it. If

can be eliminated. If any sequence from 1 to 7 below is used, circle the beginning of the" :F3." Following
are examples of where ":c3 's" can be found under real-time circumstances and the conditions which must
be present for their proper positioning:

4. F3 - c3 - LS (if L5 shorter than c3, F3 must be smaller than c3)
start of F3 or end of c3 must be exceeded swiftly)
5. F3 - c3 - c3 - c3 - L3 (last c3 or L3 should be smallest
or largest of all five Structure labels)
6. F3 - c3 - C3 - s13 - L3 (13 must be the smallest of all five Structure labels)

8. :;1 - x:c3**- :;1 (x:c3 should be less than 61.8% or more than 161.8% of the first :3)
*In this position, the" :c3" would be considered an "x-wave" of a Complex Correction. If the Structure labels surrounding
":c3" agree with those in this series, you are allowed to add an "x" in frontof ":c3." NOTE: A ":c3" can become an "x:c3,"
but the reverse is not allowed.
**In this position, the ":c3" would be considered an "x-wave" of a Complex Correction. If the Structure labels
surrounding ":c3" agree with those in this series, you are allowed to add an "x" in front of" :c3." The underlined" :3.'s" represent
compacted polywave (or higher) corrections which~ contain Position Indicators. NOTE: A ":c3" can become an
"x:c3," but the reverse is not allowed.
"x:c3"
This Structure label is the abbreviation for "center three(3) in the x-wave position." An "x:c3" can
never start or end a sequence, as a result, if a large violent move (relative to surrounding activity) takes
place after an "x:c3," it is almost always wave-a of a Non-Limiting Triangle. An "x:c3" occurs between
Standard Elliott patterns as a connecting agent to help build single corrections into larger fonnations. If
the first wave in a group contains more than one Structure label in its list of possibilities and one of those
happens to be an "x:c3," you can eliminate it. If trying to complete a three or five segment pattern and
the last leg contains an "x:c3" in its list of possibilities, obviously the "x:c3" can be eliminated.
When working with compacted corrections (whose base Structure is ":3") like those found in series
3, 4 and 9 below, the complexity of "x:c3" should never be higher than the complete Elliott pattern which
occurs before and after it. The "x:c3" will usually be one lower complexity level than the two patterns
which surround it, but on rare occasions (such as series 4), the middle ":3" may be two levels higher in
complexity than one or both "x:c3's" (see Chapter 7 for information on Complexity and Compaction).
The following are examples of where ":c3's" can be found under real-time circumstances and the
conditions which must be present for their proper positioning:

10. LS++ x:c3 ++ F3 - c3 (x:c3 must be larger than L5 and F3)
*Represents a compacted polywave (or higher) correction which should not contain an alphabetic Position Indicator
The Structure Series under list "3." and "4." above have underlines beneath their ":;i's." Those
underlines denote ":J's" which represent Compacted Elliott corrections of polywave Complexity or
higher (if you are unfamiliar with Compaction and Complexity and have at least read through the end
of Chapter 5, refer to Chapter 7 for a detailed discussion of these concepts). The corrections that these
":.3.'s" represent could be Zigzags, Flats or Triangles. If a Triangle is involved in one of these Complex
formations it will almost always be positioned as the last ":;1" in the list.
":sL3"
This Structure label is the abbreviation for "second to Last three(3)." An ":sL3" never begins or ends
an Elliott Wave pattern. This is a conditional Structure Label that cannot be present without its partner,
the ":L3" label. Whenever you contemplate using ":sL3" there must be an ":L3" immediately afterward.
This grouping oflabels always indicates one of two Elliott patterns is forming; a Terminal or a Triangle.
Therefore, the ":sL3" (along with its partner the ":L3 ") must be one offive consecutive corrective ( :3 's)
Structure labels with the ":sL3" the "second-to last" of the series. The following is the only position an
":sL3" can be found in during real-time circumstances:
1. c3 -sL3 -L3 - ? (L3 should not be more than 61.8% of sl3 OR it should be more than 100% of sl3)
":L3"
This Structure label is the abbreviation for "Last three(3)." Unlike an ":sL3" (which must be
proceeded by an ":L3"), an ":L3" label does not insist on a preceding ":sL3." Ifit is the smallest wave,
an ":L3'' requires its own price distance (plus one time unit) be completely retraced in the same amount
of time or less that the ":L3" took to form. Similar to the ":sL3" label above, an ":L3" must be part of
a Terminal or Triangle pattern and therefore requires a total of five" :3's" be found adjacent to one another
with the ":L3" the last of the five ":3's." By applying the Essential Impulse Construction Rules (Chapter
5, page 2) to the wave group, you will be able to decide whether the market is fonning a Terminal or a
Triangle. If the market action obeys the Rules found on page 5-2, a Terminal is forming; if it does not,
a Triangle is unfolding. The following are examples of Structure labels which may surround an ":L3"
under real-time conditions (NOTE: none of the ":c3's" in Structure list "I" or "2" [below] may have an
"x" in front of them):
1. F3 - c3 - c3 - c3 - L3 - ? (L3 must be larger than second OR larger than third c3, circle end of L3)
2. F3-c3-c3- sL3-L3-? (L3mustbethesmallestwave,itmustbeviolentlyretraced;circleendofL3)
3. sL3 - L3 ++ x:c3 ++ F3 (sL3 and c3 must both be larger [or sL3 and c3 must both be smaller] than L3)
Preliminary Analvsis 3-63
":5"
This Structure label is simply pronounced "five" and can represent any Impulsive wave which does
not terminate an Elliott pattern. It can be the first leg of a Zigzag or Impulse pattern OR the middle leg
of a Complex Correction or Impulse pattern. This is one of the more common Structure labels and can
be found under a multitude of conditions. If you are examining the first" :5" of a series, the market cannot
retrace more than 61.8% of it and the market must then exceed the end of the ":5." If you find conditions
counter to this requisite, the ":5" (as long as it is not the only Structure label representing ml) should be
eliminated. Below is a complete listing of where ":5" can occur along with a parenthetical description
of its implications to surrounding price action:
II :S5 11
1. ? - 5 F3 - 5 (the"?" indicates the start of the current pattern OR there is no market action before the 5)
2. ? - S - F3 - s5 - F3 (s5 must be longer than 5 and both F3's are shorter than the previous Structure label)
2. ? - S - F3 - s5 ++ x:c3 (x:c3 must be shorter than s5 and F3 must be shorter than both 5 and s5)
3. F3-5 -F3- L5 (thetwoF3'scannotshareanysimilarpriceterritoryandL5mustbelongerthan5)
4. F3 -S ++ x:c3 ++ F3 (x:c3 and first F3 must be smaller than 5; second F3 almost always longer than x:c3)
5. F3 - 5 ++ x:c3 ++ 5 (x:c3 and F3 must be smaller than first 5; second 5 must be larger than x:c3)
6. c3 - S ++ x:c3 ++ F3 (x:c3 is either16l.8% ormoreof5 or less than 61.8% of 5; if x:c3 is larger than 5
then F3must be smaller than x:c3; if x:c3 is smaller than 5, thenF3 would almost always be larger than x:c3)
This Structure label is the abbreviation for "special five (5)." It imposes specific limits on past,
present and future market action. An ":s5" can function as if it were an ":L5," but without the reversal
action normally required to confirm an ":L5." An ":s5" usually occurs in Complex Elliott formations,
but (under very limited conditions) it can be the 3rd wave of a Trending Impulse pattern with a 5th wave
Failure or with a 5th wave Extension. If you find a wave with only an ":s5" Structure label, two previous
labels (going backward in time) must be connected to the ":s5." The two sequences which must precede
the ":s5" are "5 -F3" or" F3-c3." The following are examples of where ":s5's" can be found underrealtime circumstances:
1. 5 - F3 -s5 ++ x:c3 ++ F3 (x:c3 and the first F3 must be smaller than s5)
2. 5 - F3 -s5 -F3 - L5 (both PJ's must be smaller than s5 and LS must be longer than s5)
3. F3 - c3 - SS ++ x:c3 ++ F3 (bothc3 andx:c3mustbesmallerthans5; F3willusuallybelargerthanx:c3)
":LS"
This Structure label is the abbreviation for "Last five (5)." Since an L5 is always the conclusion of
a larger Elliott pattern, the presence of an ":L5" can be the simultaneous termination of larger Degree
patterns. The minimum confirmation of an ":L5" requires that the trend.line drawn across the end of mil
and m(-2) be broken in a period of time equal to that of the" :L5" (plus one time unit) or less. To connect
an ":L5" to previous market action, the Structure label immediately before the ":L5" must be an ":F3"
or a ":c3." If you find an Impulsive Structure label (:L5, :s5 or :5) immediately before the ":L5," circle
the end of both waves. When you reach Chapter 4, search for a possible Structure Series which ends with
the earlier ":L5, :s5 or :5." Once the earlier Impulsive Structure label has been integrated into an Elliott
pattern, Compact the pattern to its base Structure (Compaction is discussed in Chapter 7), dot the start
3-64 Preliminary Analysis
and finish of it, then attempt to connect the second Impulsive Structure with the Compacted pattern and
earlier Structure labels. Examples of where ":L5's" occur under real-time conditions follows:
1. 5 - F3 - LS - ? (F3 must be shorter than both 5 and LS; circle end of LS)
2. S5 - F3 - LS - ? (LS must be longer than s5,preferably LS will be 161.8% or more of s5; circle end of LS)
3. F3 - c3 -LS - ? (if c3 is 138.2% ormoreofF3,L5 will almost certainly be shorter than c3; circle end of LS)
4. F3 - c3 -LS ++ x:c3 ++ F3 (both c3 and x:c3 must be larger than LS, F3 must be smaller than x:c3)
Pattern Isolation Procedures
If there are no ":L5's" or ":L3's" on your chart, keep updating the price action each day - applying
the Retracement and Pre-Constructive Rules - until there is a wave with only an ":L5" or ":L3" (or both)
attached. Once an ":L5" or" :L3" has been identified, the Pattern Isolation Procedures can be initiated.
From the far left of your chart, begin a forward search for the first wave which contains only an ":L5"
or an ":L3" or both; when you have found the first occurrence, circle the end of that wave (see Figure
3-31), it will probably be the end of an Elliott pattern. [The wave just circled will usually be followed
by a significant, maybe even violent, market move in a relatively short period of time. Be on the look out
for such activity; itis a reliable indication of recent Elliott pattern termination.] By applying the Position
Rules and techniques discussed in this section, that circled wave will now assist you in identifying the
start of an Elliott pattern.
From the circled point, move backward three Structure labels. If that new wave contains only one
label and it is one of the following, ":F3, x:c3, :L3, :s5 or :L5," stop there; you may have found the
beginning of an Elliott Wave pattern. If the third wave back possesses more than one Structure label,

you find one of the listed labels
or the single Structure label which it does possess is not one of those listed above, continue moving
backward one wave at a time until you find a wave with a single Structure possibility which is one of those
listed above. When you finally find a wave which meets the above requirements and it is an ":F3," ~ircle
the beginning of that wave; if it is an "x:c3, :L3, :s5 or :L5," circle the end of that wave (refer to Figure
3-32 for a demonstration of this process). Later, after a pattern has been tested and proven to be
legitimate, the circles encasing the pattern should be turned into dots ( darkened). Since all E!liott patt~rns
require an odd number of waves to complete, count the numberof waves betweeen the two circled p01nts.
If an even numberof waves is present, countinue moving backward in search of another ":F3, x:c3, :L3,
:s5 or :L5." If an odd number of waves is present, you can proceed to the next page.

Moving backward from an identified ":LS," a previously circled high is found before an ":F3, x:c3, :L3,
:s5 or :LS" is found. If the number of waves between
~ the circled points is "three or more," an Elliott pattern
may be unfolding. Make sure all waves between
those two points possess only one Structure label.
:L5
After you have accomplished that task, return to the ":L5" or ":LT' you most recently circled; then,
move forward in time until you get to the next wave which is labeled with only an ":L5" or ":L3" (or
both) and repeat the above process (see Figure 3-33). If there is not another ":L5" or ":L3" to work with,
proceed to Chapter 4 (and beyond) to verify and compact the patterns currently isolated.
When you repeat this process, frequently a high or low is found which has already been darkened
( dotted) from previous analysis. That means the current pattern actually began at the previously dotted
point (Figure 3-34) OR the previously dotted point is the end of a Compacted wave group which, as a
whole, is the same Degree as the current ":L5" or ":L3." [The previous statement would be true even ifthe
":LS" or ":L3" were one Complexity Level different from the Compacted pattern ( see Chapter 7, page .,.-
4 for details on Compaction and Complexity Levels)]. The Compacted pattern will eventually become
an integral part of a larger pattern terminating with the ":L5" or ":L3." If the current ":L5" or ":L3" occurs immediately after a dotted point (like in Figure 3-35), not enough waves occurred between the points
to create an Elliott pattern. Therefore, the base Structure of the dotted point should be used for grouping
waves when you proceed to Chapter 4. Usually, it is clear which of the two circumstances is unfolding.
No matter what type of grouping occurs, the current ":L3" or ":L5" should conclude an Elliott pattern.

The above compacted pattern is

before a larger Elliott Wave pattern can exist.
Ifless than three waves (or wave groups) are
present, the base Structure of the earlier dotted point will have to be integrated with the
L5 or L3 to become part of a larger pattern.
The larger pattern will end with the LS or L3.
Preliminarv Analysis 3-67
Special Circumstances
When in the process of simplifying Structure lists, if you find a compacted pattern's price action
exceeding its own beginning before it terminates (see Figure 3-36), the base Structure of the compacted
pattern is unequivocally corrective in nature (a ":3") no matter what the Pre-constructive Rules suggest.
Therefore, if the condition presented below in Figure 3-36 is found on your chart, do not attempt to apply
the Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic during the Reassessment process; simply retain the compacted
patterns base Structure instead. When trying to integrate these special compacted patterns with
surrounding market action, use the Position Rules to help you decide if only the base Structure of the
compacted pattern is required or if a Position Indicator is necessary to connect it to a larger Elliott pattern.

Start
You may run into difficulty when piecing together multiple polywave ( or higher) patterns if you do
not understand Complexity and its impact on market behavior and pattern interaction. Make sure
adjacent patterns (represented solely by base [:3 or :5 J or positioned Structure labels [:F3, :L5, etc.])
are never more than one Complexity Level removed. For example, if mO, m 1 and m2 were previously
identified as Standard Elliott Wave corrections and mO were Complexity Level-I, ml were Level-2 and
m2 were Level-1, the three could be combined into a larger Standard Elliott Correction. If mO were
Level-1, ml were Level-2 and m2 were Level-4, the difference between ml and m2 is two (2) Complexity
Levels; that is not allowed under the Neely Method of pattern formulation.
"Degree" is another important concept which must be understood and applied during the amalgamation of various wave segments. If you are unfamiliar with Degree and its application to price action, read
the "Rule of Similarity and Balance" on page 4-4 before attempting to eliminate Structure labels from
your chart. That section of Chapter 4 will assist you in detecting and combining waves of the same
Degree. Chapter 7, page 11, goes into more detail on the Degree concept; as your understanding of
Degree improves, you will want to become acquainted with that section, also.

The complexity of Chapter 3 warrants a brief overview of all the processes covered. When beginning
actual market analysis, first construct a chart of cash data using approximately 60 data points. Reconstruct a new chart (starting from an important top or bottom found on the first chart), but this time employ
the Rule of Proportion. Using dots, identify the end of all monowaves and apply the Rule of Neutrality
where necessary. Pick a recent monowave to analyze (do not go back more than 20 monowaves);
implementing the Rules ofObservation, place Rule, Condition and Category Identifiers at the end of each
important monowave. Next, read through the appropriate section (dictated by the Rule and Condition
[ and sometimes, Category] Identifier) under the Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic and begin transforming
the Rules into Structure labels. Locate any monowaves which contain more than one Structure label and,
using the Position Indicator Definitions and Sequences section, eliminate all but one Structure label
from the end of each m 1 and then apply the "Pattern Isolation Procedures." Your chart will then be
prepared for Chapter 4 where the grouping of Structure labels into an Elliott Series is required.

The previous chapter, Preliminary Analysis, provided you with a strong foundation on which to
continue your search for legitimate Elliott patterns. These Elliott patterns will be constructed from
groups you isolated based on rules listed at the end of Chapter 3 (see "Pattern Isolation Procedures," page
3-65). To continue a wave group's qualification process in becoming an Elliott pattern, the Structure
labels of the isolated group must adhere to a rigid sequencing scheme. In addition, certain tests will be
applied (before proceeding to Chapter 5) to make sure all wave segments are of the same Degree.
Monowave Groups
As you already know, monowaves are the building blocks of the Elliott Wave Theory. Unfortunately,
if studied individually, monowaves only provide you with a limited perspective on the future course of
a market. A greater understanding of market possibilities can be derived by grouping mono waves which
exhibit specific Structure label sequencing (which the word polywave was coined to describe). This
specific sequencing is guided by the Position Indicators preceding each Structure label.
Just like monowaves, polywaves can either be Corrective or Impulsive in nature. It takes at least three
mono waves to create a Corrective polywave. At least five mono waves are needed to create an Impulsive
polywave. At the top of the next page, Figure 4-1 illustrates an idealized Corrective pattern while Figure
4-2 depicts an idealized Impulsive pattern. As can be ascertained from a study of Figures 4-1 & 4-2,
Impulsive patterns occur when a market is gaining or losing ground (similar to Directional action, see
Chapter 3) while Corrective patterns usually travel sideward (similar to Non-Directional action).

4·2 Intermediary Observations
With singular Structure "lists" inhabiting the end of numerous monowaves on your chart, locate those
wave groups created during the "Pattern Isolation Procedures" at the end of Chapter 3. Of the groups
isolated, always choose among those which contain only three or five monowaves, those three or five
adjacent monowaves may form a Standard Elliott polywave pattern (as you gain experience, some or all
of the three or five segments chosen could be compacted wave groups). IMPORTANT: Of those wave
groupings chosen, work first on the group which consumes the least overall price and time.
The deciding factor in creating a polywave is the presence of a Structure Series found among the
isolated string of monowaves. A Structure Series is an organized listing of properly Positioned Structure
labels which combine to form an Elliott pattern (see top of Figure 4-3 on previous page). Through the
process of Compaction, Structure Series' will allow you to amalgamate many simple Elliott Wave
patterns into more complex patterns in a logical, natural fashion.
Figure 4-3 illustrates the Position Indicator sequencing and the exact number of ":3's" and ":S's"
which must be present to create a Standard or Non-Standard Elliott pattern. If some of the waves you
are dealing with are compacted and only possess their base Structure label, the compacted pattern's base
Structure can represent any legal Positioned Structure label of the same Class (for a definition of "Class"
refer to page 2-4). Any pattern above monowave development must conform to one of the four Standard
Structure Series' or one of the various varieties of Non-Standard Series'. [Notice, in the last sentence only
fQJJr.Structure Series' were mentioned. F.h!.f.Standard Structure Series' are listed in Figure 4-3 , but only
four of those Series' are actually unique. The last Standard Series, ":3-:3-:3-:3-:3," is repeated and can
be used to create two separate patterns with vastly different implications. Depending on the shape of
the waves grouped ( and other conditions introduced in Chapter 5 ), you will be able to decide which of
the two patterns is unfolding.] Figure 4-3 illustrates and names these combinations allowing you to
further define development on your chart. Notice, some Structure labels in Figure 4-3 do not contain
Position Indicators. When Position Indicators are not present in this official listing, any Position
Indicator "legally" allowed in front of the Structure label in question could be used.
When comparing the isolated wave groupings on your chart with those in Figure 4-3, and your
grouping is composed strictly of monowaves, one of the "Standard Patterns" at the top portion of Figure
4-3 should be appropriate. If you have already Compacted some previous price action and an "x:c3"
occurs anywhere in your isolated wave group, one of the Non-Standard Patterns will take effect.
No matter how large or time consuming, all grouped market action pegged for analysis must match
one of the Structure Series listed in Figure 4-3. Your goal is to find a Structure Series listed which mimics
the one on your chart. Ultimately, the identification of Structure Series' is paramount in your search for
larger, reliable wave patterns. Once a series has been found, many additional tests (some covered
immediately after this section and some covered in Chapters 5-12) must be conducted to elevate your
monowave group to polywave status.
Rule of Similarity & Balance
Once an acceptable Structure Series has been identified, the Rule of Similarity & Balance must be
considered. All Elliott patterns depend on combining like with like. Waves that are not "similar" cannot
be combined to complete a larger Elliott formation.
Market action develops under two general categories -price and time. For two adjacent waves to be
"similar" the relationship between the two waves should fall into a specific relational range based on
price or based on time or a combination of the two. Similarities of price and time can simultaneously
occur between adjacent waves but are not necessary to pass inspection under this Rule.
Intermediary Observations 4-3
When comparing adjacent waves within an Impulse pattern, similarities of rime are more common
than price; in Corrective patterns, similarities of price are more common than time. To decide whether
two adjacent waves are "similar" is a matter of simple mathematics. Following are instructions on how
to detect similarities based on the two elements (price and time) which define market action.
~
For there to exist a price similarity between two adjacent waves, the smaller of the two waves should
be no less than one-third (1/3) in price of the larger wave.
Tum
For time similarity to be present between two adjacent waves, the shorter time pattern should not
be less than one third of the longer time pattern.
If you have been following along with your own chart and have one or more isolated groups which
adhere to an Elliott Structure Series, only investigate those Series where all adjacent waves adhere
to one or both of the above Rules of Similarity and Balance. If in any comparison, neither of the above
Rules is obeyed, the likelihood two adjacent waves are of the same Degree is very slim. When two waves
are not of the same Degree, they cannot be directly or immediately connected to form a larger Elliott
pattern; Compaction of several or more smaller waves will first be required.

In Figure 4-4, the Rule of Similarity and Balance is not adhered to in either respect indicating ml and
m2 are not of the same Degree; therefore, m 1 and m2 cannot be directly combined. To eventually include
ml and m2 within the same Elliott pattern, m2 has to be connected to waves of similar price and time.
Those waves will have to be grouped and identified as an Elliott pattern, tested, confirmed and then
reassessed. Afterward, if the waves grouped with m2 consume enough rime or price to relate tom 1 (based
on the Rule of Similarity and Balance), ml and m2's group can be combined with surrounding action to
create a larger Elliott pattern. In Figure 4-5, both conditions of the Rule of Similarity and Balance are
obeyed indicating the two waves might be of the same Degree. Consequently, if Structure labels allow,
ml and m2 may be directly attached as part of a larger Elliott pattern. NOTE: Just because two waves
adhere to the Rule of Similarity and Balance does not mean they are of the same Degree, it just indicates
they might be.

To illustrate how the identification of Structure Series' assists you in the wave building process over
an extended period and how larger and larger Elliott patterns develop and are detected, the following
Rounds have been created:
Round 1
Using the Rules and techniques described in Chapter 3, all monowaves in Figure 4-6 have Ix:en
Structurally labeled. Isolated between the beginning of Chrono-2 and the end of Chrono-4, the Senes
"F3-c3-L5" occurs. Looking at the Table in Figure 4-3, that Series can be identified as a possible Flat
pattern. Beginning with Chrono-9 and ending with Chrono-11, a Zigzag Series (5-F3-L5) is found.
Chrono-12 through Chrono-16 form an Impulse Series.

Round2
All wave groups (the Flat, Zigzag and Impulse) identified in Round 1 have been thoroughly tested
and have proven their validity. Therefore, they were Compacted (see Chapter 7 for details) to their base
Structure of ":;3_" or ":,5_" (the underline represents Complexity level; refer to Chapter 7) and the circles
encasing the Elliott wave pattern have been darkened. Figure 4-7 displays these transformations.
On your return to the Retracement Rules in Chapter 3, all Compacted patterns must be analyzed as
if they were single waves containing one Structure label. Initially, the Compacted patterns must go
through reassessment to detect for the possible existence of "missing" waves. Also, the two Structure
labels adjacent to the Compacted pattern must be reassessed to decide if the changed environment
(caused by the Compacted pattern) has had any influence on surrounding market Structure.
In Figure 4-7, all of these procedures have been carried out with the results exhibited therein. Notice,
just as directed in Chapter 3, all labels and markings between the boundaries of the Compacted patterns
have been eliminated.
Round 3
During Round 3, no Structure labels containing "L" Position Indicators are present. Until additional
price action is plotted and a new ":L5" or ":L3" appears, no further progress can be made with pattern
construction . What can be derived from the chart (Figure 4-8) as it currently stands. An uptrend began
with Chrono-1 which, according to the table in Figure 4-3, cannot terminate until another Impulsive
advance unfolds ( very valuable information indeed). Under these circumstances, you know the proper
strategy would be to .stay long until another advance satisfied the required Impulsive characteristics.
Figure4-8

Intermediary Observations 4-7
Zigzag "DETOUR" Test
Whenever you find an ":L5" which concludes a possible Zigzag pattern, always be aware that the
Zigzag could really be the last three segments of an Impulse pattern. For example, in Figure 4-7 after
the first ":F3" (moving forward from the low marked "Important Low") a ":5 :F3 - :L5" Zigzag Series
can be found. In isolation, the waves make a legitimate Zigzag pattern. On the other hand, if you connect
market action preceding the first leg of the Zigzag, an Impulsive Series can be created beginning at the
"Important Low."
Whenever you are working with Zigzags, always check the two Structure labels preceding to assure
no Impulsive pattern is accidentally overlooked. If an Impulse Series can be assembled by connecting
two previous Structure labels to the Structure Series (see Figure 4-9), always test the Impulsive pattern
(applying the guidelines described in Chapters 5-12) before attempting to work with the Zigzag. If the
Impulse pattern obeys typical construction Rules, use it. If the Impulse does not adhere to all the Rules,
drop the first two Structure labels, return to the Zigzag scenario and test it for reliable construction. If
the Zigzag is well constructed, use it. If the Zigzag does not obey the Rules, skip that section of the chart
and work on another area until surrounding action clarifies the situation.

What Next?
Whenever working with a Zigzag, to guarantee an Impulse
pattern is not overlooked, make sure the two Structure labels
before the Zigzag cannot be used to make a larger Impulse
pattern. If an Impulse Series is present, proper testing of the
pattern must occur before considering the Zigzag possibility.
If the Impulse idea is invalid, return to the Zigzag scenario.
Once you reach this point, you have identified a possible Elliott pattern which will now need to be
run through a battery of tests to see if it really is what it appears to be. If your wave group obeys one of
the Standard Patterns Series' in Figure 4-3, move on to Chapter 5. If the wave group follows one of the
Non-Standard Pattern Series' and you feel you have enough experience to tackle a Complex pattern,
proceed to Chapter 8.

Until now, the main focus of the book has been on mono waves, a very basic concept. The more
advanced stages of Wave Theory application require a "group"mind set, Monowave combinations. The
"Structure Series" was a step in that direction. To continue the analytical process, more specific rules
will need to be introduced to further differentiate between Impulsive and Corrective action. Exacting,
bottom line rules will be presented for every filllilWl.rd Elliott pattern and its respective variations.
As you know from the previous section, each Structure Series represents a particular Elliott pattern.
One of the more important aspects of pattern identification depends on appearance. Unfortunately,
because of numerous Impulsive and Corrective pattern variations, there is no "standard" way of
diagrarning either category that reflects the realistic appearance of each variation. Elliott, in all of his
writings, used illustrations similar to those found in Figure 5-1. The figures on the left were intended
to represent Impulsive patterns. Those on the right were drawn to represent a certain type of Corrective
pattern. The unrealistic nature of these diagrams tends to wrongly influence the perceptions and
expectations of the beginning student on how wave patterns should really look. Avoiding this problem,
which has continued up to the present, required this book contain hundreds of diagrams which do reflect
realistic wave behavior. These diagrams will allow you to quickly become accustomed to the correct
appearance of Elliott patterns, thus significantly diminishing the period between preliminary investigation and actual application of the Theory to real-time market action.
Construction of Polywaves
We have been working with "Structure Series" combinations to detect possible polywave development, but no rules have been presented to explain how Polywaves should look or behave based on their
Class. Let's do that now.
Central Considerations 5-1
Figure 5-1
Standardized Corrections (unrealistic)
Standardized Impulse patterns (very unrealistic)
Impulsions
There are specific guidelines which apply to Impulse patterns that are not present in most Corrective
patterns. Presented here will be behavior confining rules designed to solidify (or negate) groups of
monowaves into patterns which are "Impulsive in nature."
Essential Construction Rules

Market action must adhere to the following rules to be considered a candidate for Impulsive behavior:
1. Five adjacent segments must be present (monowave or larger), which meet the
Structure Series requirements of a Trending or Terminal pattern,
2. Three of those five segments must "thrust" in the same upward or downward direction.
3. Immediately after the first segment, a minor move in the opposite direction takes
place (the second. segment). T.his seco~~ segme~t can never retrace allofthe first.
4. The thir<l segment m~st be longer than the second,
5. Immediately after the third segnient, a minor move in the op~ifedir~ti?n c,f the
third (but the same direction ~ the second) takes place (segment fo~r l: ;:i·,e fourth
segment must never retrace all of the third. . . .. ·. · i · ·. . . . . . . ... < / / . ·
6. The fifth segment will almost always be longer than the fourth, but only~
38.2% of the fourth segment (price wise). When the fifth segment is shorter than the
fourth, the fifth segment is termed a "failure."
7. When the vertical price distances covered by the first, third, and fifth segments are
measured and compared, the third does not have to be the longest, but it~ ~ be
the shortest of the three segments.
If a single one of the above rules is not adhered to, the market action being analyzed, by default, must
be Corrective in nature, not Impulsive OR your wave group is incorrectly combined. If the pattern you
are analyzing does not follow the above criteria, proceed to the Correction section (page 5-16).
5-2 Central Considerations
Application to market action
We now have some general, broad application rules at our disposal for the detection of potential
Impulse behavior. To make use of them, we need to work with five adjacent, "similar" monowaves.
Figure 5-2 has multiple "five monowave" groups forus to study. Once we have gone through each pattern
in the illustration, you should get out your own "wave chart" and practice the application of the "Essential
Construction" rules on groups of real-time monowaves. These are the most critical rules of the entire
Theory. You should not continue with your study of "Mastering Elliott Wave" until you are able to
correctly apply these rules to real-time market action.
Making use of the "Essential Construction" rules, let's take a look at some monowave combinations
and decide which patterns have Impulsive potential and which do not. Remember, if a pattern does not
meet all of the rules, it cannot be Impulsive, it must automatically be Corrective. In Figure 5-2:
A fails the test since the 2nd segment retraces all of the first (see Rule 3, page 5-2).
B does not break any of the rules, so is possibly an Impulsive pattern.
C also obeys all of the aforementioned rules.
There are only four segments in D, five are required (see Rule 1).
In E, the 3rd segment is the shortest of the three advancing segments, an Impulsive pattern is impossible (see Rule 7).
F is up for consideration.
In G, the 4th segment retraces all of the 3rd, that is not allowable (see Rule 5).
There are no rules broken in H, I, nor J (in J, the 5th segment is shorter than the 4th, creating a "failure").
K is acceptable in all respects except for one, the third segment is not longer than segment two (see Rule 4)

Central Considerations 5-3
Extension Rule - (the Litmus Test)
An Extemion is an essential element of any reliable Impulse pattern and is exclusively associated
with them. The term Extension is used to describe "the longest wave" in an Impulsive grouping. The
presence (or lack) of an Extended wave is the analytical "fork in the road," delineating Impulsive from
Corrective behavior. This test will virtually always separate real Impulse patterns from imitations
(Corrections).
By following all of the rules up to this point, you should be working with a group of five monowaves
(or higher, if your abilities have increased). Among this group, one wave should be noticeably longer
in price than all the others. The longest wave will be the Extension candidate. To actually qualify as
an Extension, the longest wave should be at least 161.8% of the next longest wave (price-wise).
If a pattern has followed all of the Impulse rules up to the present, including the Extension Rule, move
on to the next section in this chapter to verify whether the wave group meets further Impulsive
requirements. [NOTE: If this test is passed, but you still feel the pattern is corrective (based on
severe retracement of the move by later market action or other more subtle observations, which will be
explained later), a wave hidden in the price action may be the reason for the odd Corrective
construction (see Missing Waves, page 12-34).]
On the other hand, if any of the rules up to this point were not followed, it would virtually guarantee
the pattern is corrective with two important, but~ exceptions:
1. When thefim segment in a pattern is the longest, it might be slightly shorter than 161.8% of the
third segment, but the third will not conclude higher than 61.8% beyond the end of the first.
2. When the third segment is the longest, but less than 161.8% of the first, and the fifth segment is
shorter than the third, there is the remote possibility the market is forming an extremely rare
Terminal Impulse pattern variation (see Terminal Impulse, Wave-3 Extended, page 11-6).
When the Extension Rule is broken, and neither of the two above exceptions is unfolding, the market
is absolutely experiencing a Correction; proceed to the "Corrections" section. If one of the above two
situations does appear to be unfolding, continue with your assumption the pattern is Impulsive and
proceed to the next heading.
Introduction of Progress Labels to the Wave Group
If your pattern has passed the Extension test, you are finally ready for the placement of Progress
Labels to your price charts. Progress Labels serve the purpose of testing market activity for the presence
of very specific attributes. The testing will provide you with enough "ammunition" to allow for confident
conclusions and the eventual solidification of the proposed wave pattern.
Here is how the Progress Labels should be placed: The first segment of your pattern will be
considered wave-I. The second segment will be wave-2, the third wave-3, the fourth wave-4 and the fifth
wave-5. Place these labels in order on your chart at the termination of each wave.
Conditional Construction Rules
Hllffllmlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I II I I I I I I I I I
There is a great deal of difference between market action which does not break any of the Essential
Impulse Construction rules and an actual impulse pattern. The Essential Impulse Construction rules,
discussed a few headings back, are for general application to all Impulse wave patterns. They are the
first rules to employ on market action believed to be Impulsive in nature. If a single "Essential" rule is
5-4 Central Considerations
broken, there is no need to proceed to the next stage oflmpulse examination. Automatically assume the
pattern is Corrective, QI you have started your analysis from an improper point in the count, QI all of the
monowaves involved in the sequence are not of the same degree (for details, see "Degree," page 5-12).
If you are following along with your own real-time price chart, all the rules after this point will be
dependent on the Progress Labels you recently placed on your wave pattern.
Rule of Alternation
The concept of Alternation is one of the most important, guiding influences on market action and
is at the very foundation of the Wave Principle. Without it, the Theory would be basically useless. It
applies to virtually all aspects of application (for additional information on Alternation, see page 8-19).
The Rule states that: when adjacent or alternate waves of the same Degree are compared, they
should be distinctive and unique in as many ways as possible. The major, deciding factor in the full
manifestation of the rule is time. The greater the time period covered by each formation, the more
complete, in all respects, the Alternation between the two formations will

End of wave-a, start of wave-b s:::J
There are more variations on Flat patterns than any other Elliott formation. To get a general idea of
what type is taking place, the following technique should be implemented. Draw two horizontal, parallel
lines, one off the highest point of the first monowave and the other off the lowest point of the first
monowave (see Figure 5-21). This will provide an accurate measuring tool to detect the differences
between one Flat variation and another.
Beginning the observations, if wave-b breaks the horizontal line opposite its starting point, the
market action indicates a "stronger than normal" Flat is forming (refer to Strong B-Wave, below). If the
b-wave retraces between 81-100% of wave-a, refer to Normal B-Waves. If the retracement of wave-a
is between 61.8-80%, refer to Weak B-Waves.
Strong B-wave
Depending on the size of the b-wave in relation to wave-a, the c-wave may or may not exceed the
beginning of wave-b. If the b-wave falls between 101-123.6% of wave-a, there still exists a relatively
good chance wave-c will completely retrace wave-b. If the b-wave falls within the above range, the cwave is 100% or more ofwave-b and wave-c is not more than 161.8% of wave-a, the market is forming
an Irregular correction. If the c-wave is more than 161.8% of wave-a, designate the pattern an Elongated
Flat.
If the b-wave is more than 123.6% of wave-a, there is little chance wave-c will retrace all ofwaveb. If it does, it will still be an Irregular pattern. When the b-wave exceeds 138.2% of wave-a, there is
no chance the c-wave will retrace all of wave-b (the c-wave of a Triangle might, but not the c-wave of
a Flat). As long as part of wave-c falls within the range of the horizontal parallel lines, but does not
completely retrace wave-b, the pattern should be considered an Irregular Failure. If the c-wave does
nQ1 fall within the horizontal, parallel lines, the pattern should be considered a Running Co"ection.
Once the specific Flat variation taking place is known*, proceed to the "Conditional Rules" section
(page 5-34) for further testing of the pattern.
Normal B-wave
The b-wave, to be considered "normal," should fall between 81-100% (inclusive) of wave-a. Under
these conditions, the c-wave will most likely retrace all of wave-b. If the length of wave-c falls between
100-138.2% of wave-b, the pattern should be considered a Common Flat. If the c-wave is more than
138.2% of wave-b, the market is forming an Elongated Flat. If the c-wave is less than 100% ofwaveb, the pattern is a C-Failure. *
* Knowing what type of Flat pattern is forming during your early stages of study will not be that helpful, but will be of
great assistance and application at a later date. If you feel you have assimilated everything up to this point and are ready
for some new ''formation solidifying" guidelines, refer to Chapters JO & I1 at this juncture and then return to Chapter 5.
5-18 Central Considerations
Weak B-wave
Weak b-waves are characterized by their less than normal retracement of wave-a. To classify as a
weak b-wave, it must retrace between 61.8% -80% (inclusive) of wave-a. If the c-wave is less than 100%
of wave-b, the pattern should be called aDouble Failure. If wave-c is between 100% - 138.2% of waveb, the pattern should be called a B-F ailure. If wave-c is longer than 138.2% of wave-b, it will once again
fall under the Elongated Flat category.*
Zi,:Za,:s (5-3-5)
There is a limited number of variations on Zig Zag patterns. ZigZags and their complex combinations
· (see Chapter 8) are the only corrective patterns which can temporarily "resemble" Impulsive activity. To
avoid misinterpretation, very specific Ji mits must be placed on Zigzag behavior. Below are the minimum
requirements which allow a pattern to be categorized as a ZigZag.
1. Wave-a should not retrace more than 61.8% of the previous Impulse wave (if present) of one
larger degree (see Figure 5-22a).

If your wave group has followed these three minimum parameters, it is time to check for adherence
to the maximum limits imposed on wave-b of a ZigZag.
1. No part of wave-b will normally retrace more than 61.8% of wave-a.
2. If part of wave-b retraces more than 61.8% of wave-a, that part will not be the end of
wave-b. It will only be the first segment of a more complex correction for wave-b. The
termination of wave-b will complete at 61.8% of wave-a~ (see Figure 5-24).

The length of wave-c is the deciding factor for categorizing a ZigZag formation. It's length says many
things about the current and future market action. If the c-wave of the Zigzag you are working with is
less than 61.8% of wave-a, refer to Truncated Zigzag. If the c-wave completes at a point which is more
than 161.8% of wave-a added to the end of wave-a, move to the "Elongated Zigzag" section (be careful
with this pattern, it could be part of an Impulse wave). In any other situation, refer to "Normal Zigzags".
Normal
In a Norma/Zigzag, the c-wave can be anywhere from 61.8% to 161.8% (Internally and Externally,
for details, refer to page 12-22) of wave-a. The listing below describes and illustrates the conditions
necessary for Normal Zigzag formation.
1. Wave-b ( when measured from its terminus) must not retrace more than 61.8% of wave-a. Figure
5-24 (previous page) shows several situations which allow for, or negate, Zigzag formation.

When a move, which you think is a c-wave, exceeds the limits described above, refer to "Elongated
Zigzag" (page 5-22) and/or "Impulsions" (page 5-2).
Truncated
This is the rarest Zigzag variation, to be justified it must meet the following criteria:
1. Wave-c cannot be shorter than 38.2% of wave-a, but should be less than 61.8% of wave-a.
2. After completion of the Zigzag, the market must retrace at least 81 % of the entire Zigzag, and
preferably, it should retrace 100% or more (Figure 5-26, next page).
This is essential due to the counter trend strength indicated by the extremely short c-wave.
3. The pattern will most likely be found as J2I!.1< of the five legs of a Triangle or as a segment of one
of the legs of a Triangle.

Triangles (3-3-3-3-3)
Some of the most difficult patterns to work with underthe Wave Theory are variations of Triangles.
They have no specific time limits for completion. Absolute certainty as to the direction of postTriangular action is often impossible. One of their redeeming qualities is that after they complete, they
provide a significant amount of information on current market position and offer numerous clues on how
post-triangular price action should behave for extended periods of time.
Despite their difficulties, Triangles are some of the most common Elliott patterns; therefore, a
thorough understanding of them is essential. Learning to identify Triangles early in their formation can
save you from many hours of from frustration and from unnecessary trading losses (especially in
Options). Following are the most important Rules and characteristics of Triangular formations. The
majority of these Rules ( which are essential) are presented here for the first time, so pay close attention.
Following is a list of minimum requirements in the formation of all Triangle variations:
1. Elliott said there are five segments to a Triangle, no more, no less. This rule applies no matter
how simple or complex each segment is. In order of occurrence, each segment of the Triangle
is given a letter of the alphabet: (a,b,c,d,e).
(see Figure 5-29)
2. Each Segment of the Triangle is ( or represents, in the case of monowaves) a Complete Corrective
phase (a ":3").
Figure 5-29
As in an Impulse sequence, three of the Corrective patterns go
with the corrective trend and two go against the corrective trend.
The~ trend is down The~ trend is up
3. Unlike an Impulse pattern, which tends to trend up or down, the five segments of a Triangle will
oscillate over and over in the same price territory (overlap) with a slightly Expanding or
Contracting bias (Figure 5-30, next page).
4. The Triangle can drift slightly upward or downward without affecting these general guidelines
(see Figure 5-31, next page).
5. The length of wave-b must fall between 38.2-261.8% of wave-a. NOTE: there is a strong tendency
for wave-b to avoid a 100% price relation to wave-a.

The apex point of the Triangle can be raised or lowered to
any extent between the two limits designated by the dashed
lines without bringing up any additional possibilities. Once
the trendlines are going in the same general direction ( up or
down), both a Terminal Impulse and a Running Triangle
must be considered as possible patterns.
6. Of the five segments in a Triangle, four retrace a previous segment. The retracing segments are
waves b,c,d & e. Of those four. three sefilllents must retrace at least 50% of the previous wave
(see Figure 5-32). During a rare Running Triangle, this parameter may not be completely met.
Figure5-32 Thee-wave does not need to retrace a lot of wave-din
this case since three of the other retracements were

7. When dealing with the important reference points in a Triangle, there are six you
need to be concerned with. They are all of the same degree:
i. The beginning of wave-a, which is called point "O" (zero)
ii. End of wave-a, point "a"
iii. End of wave-b, "b"
iv. End of wave-c, "c"
v. Endofwave-d, "d"
vi. End of wave-e, "e"
Only four of the terminal points (of the same degree) in a Triangle should be channeled between
contracting trendlines. NOTE: Non-Limiting Triangles usually follow this rule, but there are occasional --
exceptions which may create a 5th touch point (see Figure 5-33 for an illustration of this Rule).
Figure 5-33 (continued on next page)
Each dark dot represents a possible touch point which
you can employ to draw converging trendlines which
encase the triangle. Only four ( of the six) turning points
can simultaneously touch the converging trendlines. W

Note that there are two points of the same degree which do not
-touch the trendlines. The beginning of wave-a (where the Triangle began) and the end of wave-e (the end of the Triangle).
8. The channel line crossing waves B & D in a Triangle should be thought of as the Base line. Its
function is similar to a 2-4 trendline in an Impulse wave. As a general rule, the B-D trendline
should not be broken by any part of wave C or E in the Triangle (Figure 5-34a). In other words,
there should be a clear path from wave B to D and from wave D until the end of wave E. Figure
5-34b illustrates behavior around the Triangle's B-D trendline which is not acceptable.

**Contracting Triangles (general)**
Contracting Triangles are, by far, the most common type of triangle. Following is a list of necessary
elements in the formation of a Contracting Triangle.
Minimum Requirements (all Contracting Triangles):
1. After a Contracting Triangle completes, there occurs a "thrust" that must be at least 75% of the
widest segment of the Triangle and under "normal" circumstances will not exceed 125% of the
widest segment (Figure 5-35).

There are more variations on Flat patterns than any other Elliott formation. To get a general idea of
what type is taking place, the following technique should be implemented. Draw two horizontal, parallel
lines, one off the highest point of the first monowave and the other off the lowest point of the first
monowave (see Figure 5-21). This will provide an accurate measuring tool to detect the differences
between one Flat variation and another.
Beginning the observations, if wave-b breaks the horizontal line opposite its starting point, the
market action indicates a "stronger than normal" Flat is forming (refer to Strong B-Wave, below). If the
b-wave retraces between 81-100% of wave-a, refer to Normal B-Waves. If the retracement of wave-a
is between 61.8-80%, refer to Weak B-Waves.
Strong B-wave
Depending on the size of the b-wave in relation to wave-a, the c-wave may or may not exceed the
beginning of wave-b. If the b-wave falls between 101-123.6% of wave-a, there still exists a relatively
good chance wave-c will completely retrace wave-b. If the b-wave falls within the above range, the cwave is 100% or more ofwave-b and wave-c is not more than 161.8% of wave-a, the market is forming
an Irregular correction. If the c-wave is more than 161.8% of wave-a, designate the pattern an Elongated
Flat.
If the b-wave is more than 123.6% of wave-a, there is little chance wave-c will retrace all ofwaveb. If it does, it will still be an Irregular pattern. When the b-wave exceeds 138.2% of wave-a, there is
no chance the c-wave will retrace all of wave-b (the c-wave of a Triangle might, but not the c-wave of
a Flat). As long as part of wave-c falls within the range of the horizontal parallel lines, but does not
completely retrace wave-b, the pattern should be considered an Irregular Failure. If the c-wave does
nQ1 fall within the horizontal, parallel lines, the pattern should be considered a Running Co"ection.
Once the specific Flat variation taking place is known*, proceed to the "Conditional Rules" section
(page 5-34) for further testing of the pattern.
Normal B-wave
The b-wave, to be considered "normal," should fall between 81-100% (inclusive) of wave-a. Under
these conditions, the c-wave will most likely retrace all of wave-b. If the length of wave-c falls between
100-138.2% of wave-b, the pattern should be considered a Common Flat. If the c-wave is more than
138.2% of wave-b, the market is forming an Elongated Flat. If the c-wave is less than 100% ofwaveb, the pattern is a C-Failure. *
* Knowing what type of Flat pattern is forming during your early stages of study will not be that helpful, but will be of
great assistance and application at a later date. If you feel you have assimilated everything up to this point and are ready
for some new ''formation solidifying" guidelines, refer to Chapters JO & I1 at this juncture and then return to Chapter 5.
5-18 Central Considerations
Weak B-wave
Weak b-waves are characterized by their less than normal retracement of wave-a. To classify as a
weak b-wave, it must retrace between 61.8% -80% (inclusive) of wave-a. If the c-wave is less than 100%
of wave-b, the pattern should be called aDouble Failure. If wave-c is between 100% - 138.2% of waveb, the pattern should be called a B-F ailure. If wave-c is longer than 138.2% of wave-b, it will once again
fall under the Elongated Flat category.*
Zi,:Za,:s (5-3-5)
There is a limited number of variations on Zig Zag patterns. ZigZags and their complex combinations
· (see Chapter 8) are the only corrective patterns which can temporarily "resemble" Impulsive activity. To
avoid misinterpretation, very specific Ji mits must be placed on Zigzag behavior. Below are the minimum
requirements which allow a pattern to be categorized as a ZigZag.
1. Wave-a should not retrace more than 61.8% of the previous Impulse wave (if present) of one
larger degree (see Figure 5-22a).

If your wave group has followed these three minimum parameters, it is time to check for adherence
to the maximum limits imposed on wave-b of a ZigZag.
1. No part of wave-b will normally retrace more than 61.8% of wave-a.
2. If part of wave-b retraces more than 61.8% of wave-a, that part will not be the end of
wave-b. It will only be the first segment of a more complex correction for wave-b. The
termination of wave-b will complete at 61.8% of wave-a~ (see Figure 5-24).

The length of wave-c is the deciding factor for categorizing a ZigZag formation. It's length says many
things about the current and future market action. If the c-wave of the Zigzag you are working with is
less than 61.8% of wave-a, refer to Truncated Zigzag. If the c-wave completes at a point which is more
than 161.8% of wave-a added to the end of wave-a, move to the "Elongated Zigzag" section (be careful
with this pattern, it could be part of an Impulse wave). In any other situation, refer to "Normal Zigzags".
Normal
In a Norma/Zigzag, the c-wave can be anywhere from 61.8% to 161.8% (Internally and Externally,
for details, refer to page 12-22) of wave-a. The listing below describes and illustrates the conditions
necessary for Normal Zigzag formation.

When a move, which you think is a c-wave, exceeds the limits described above, refer to "Elongated

Truncated
This is the rarest Zigzag variation, to be justified it must meet the following criteria:
1. Wave-c cannot be shorter than 38.2% of wave-a, but should be less than 61.8% of wave-a.
2. After completion of the Zigzag, the market must retrace at least 81 % of the entire Zigzag, and
preferably, it should retrace 100% or more (Figure 5-26, next page).
This is essential due to the counter trend strength indicated by the extremely short c-wave.
3. The pattern will most likely be found as J2I!.1< of the five legs of a Triangle or as a segment of one
of the legs of a Triangle.

Triangles (3-3-3-3-3)
Some of the most difficult patterns to work with underthe Wave Theory are variations of Triangles.
They have no specific time limits for completion. Absolute certainty as to the direction of postTriangular action is often impossible. One of their redeeming qualities is that after they complete, they
provide a significant amount of information on current market position and offer numerous clues on how
post-triangular price action should behave for extended periods of time.
Despite their difficulties, Triangles are some of the most common Elliott patterns; therefore, a
thorough understanding of them is essential. Learning to identify Triangles early in their formation can
save you from many hours of from frustration and from unnecessary trading losses (especially in
Options). Following are the most important Rules and characteristics of Triangular formations. The
majority of these Rules ( which are essential) are presented here for the first time, so pay close attention.
Following is a list of minimum requirements in the formation of all Triangle variations:
1. Elliott said there are five segments to a Triangle, no more, no less. This rule applies no matter
how simple or complex each segment is. In order of occurrence, each segment of the Triangle
is given a letter of the alphabet: (a,b,c,d,e).
(see Figure 5-29)
2. Each Segment of the Triangle is ( or represents, in the case of monowaves) a Complete Corrective
phase (a ":3").
Figure 5-29
As in an Impulse sequence, three of the Corrective patterns go
with the corrective trend and two go against the corrective trend.
The~ trend is down The~ trend is up
3. Unlike an Impulse pattern, which tends to trend up or down, the five segments of a Triangle will
oscillate over and over in the same price territory (overlap) with a slightly Expanding or
Contracting bias (Figure 5-30, next page).
4. The Triangle can drift slightly upward or downward without affecting these general guidelines
(see Figure 5-31, next page).
5. The length of wave-b must fall between 38.2-261.8% of wave-a. NOTE: there is a strong tendency
for wave-b to avoid a 100% price relation to wave-a.

lines without bringing up any additional possibilities. Once
the trendlines are going in the same general direction ( up or
down), both a Terminal Impulse and a Running Triangle
must be considered as possible patterns.
6. Of the five segments in a Triangle, four retrace a previous segment. The retracing segments are
waves b,c,d & e. Of those four. three sefilllents must retrace at least 50% of the previous wave
(see Figure 5-32). During a rare Running Triangle, this parameter may not be completely met.

7. When dealing with the important reference points in a Triangle, there are six you
need to be concerned with. They are all of the same degree:
i. The beginning of wave-a, which is called point "O" (zero)
ii. End of wave-a, point "a"
iii. End of wave-b, "b"
iv. End of wave-c, "c"
v. Endofwave-d, "d"
vi. End of wave-e, "e"
Only four of the terminal points (of the same degree) in a Triangle should be channeled between
contracting trendlines. NOTE: Non-Limiting Triangles usually follow this rule, but there are occasional --
exceptions which may create a 5th touch point (see Figure 5-33 for an illustration of this Rule).
Figure 5-33 (continued on next page)

you can employ to draw converging trendlines which
encase the triangle. Only four ( of the six) turning points
can simultaneously touch the converging trendlines. W

8. The channel line crossing waves B & D in a Triangle should be thought of as the Base line. Its
function is similar to a 2-4 trendline in an Impulse wave. As a general rule, the B-D trendline
should not be broken by any part of wave C or E in the Triangle (Figure 5-34a). In other words,
there should be a clear path from wave B to D and from wave D until the end of wave E. Figure
5-34b illustrates behavior around the Triangle's B-D trendline which is not acceptable.

**Contracting Triangles (general)**
Contracting Triangles are, by far, the most common type of triangle. Following is a list of necessary
elements in the formation of a Contracting Triangle.
Minimum Requirements (all Contracting Triangles):
1. After a Contracting Triangle completes, there occurs a "thrust" that must be at least 75% of the
widest segment of the Triangle and under "normal" circumstances will not exceed 125% of the
widest segment (Figure 5-35).

2. In a Contracting Triangle, the thrust must exceed the highest QI lowest price (depending on the
direction of the thrust) achieved during the formation of the triangle (Figure 5-36).
Figure 5-36
When a Triangle is about to complete, draw two parallel horizontal lines. One should be drawn across the highest
price level achieved during the fonnation of the Triangle; the other across the lowest price level. Following the
guidelines below, those parallel lines will help you predict what to expect after the Triangle completes. The only
exception to this Rule would occur when the Triangle noticeably drifts in the opposite direction of its thrust.
If "thrust" is up,
this price level
must be reached
---------" If "thrust" is down,
this price level
must be reached
3. Thee-wave must be the smallest wave in the Triangle (based on price, not time), see Figure 5-37.

I. Limiting (specific)
"Limiting" are the type of Triangles that Elliott discovered and talked about in his original writings.
They occur in 4th-waves and b-waves. The post triangular action of a Limiting Triangle is constricted
within very specific parameters, hence the name Limiting. The termination of wave-e in these patterns
should occur from 20-40% before the apex point of the Triangle. Below are all three variations of
Limiting Triangles and the specific formation rules which make them unique
a. Horizontal Variation
Of the Contracting Triangles, the Horizontal is the most common. When the market obeys the list
of rules below, it indicates a Horizontal triangle is forming.
1. The trendlines of the Triangle must travel in opposite price directions (see Figure 5-38).
5-28 Central Considerations
Figure5-38
The trendlines are going
in opposite directions.
2. The Apex point of the Triangle must fall within a range 61.8% of the longest segment of the
Triangle, centered in the middle of the longest segment (see Figure 5-39).
Figure 5-39 \ lb~ ~Iges~av}e
\' 'v/\ _ ~ 61>%ofW,~b.remeredioW,~b'sra,go
The same technique would apply if the a- For the Triangle to follow the rules under
wave or the c-wave were the longest wave. the horizontal section, the apex of the Triangle should fall somewhere in this range
3. Wave-d must be smaller than wave-c (see Figure 5-40).
Figure5-40
J Wave--d covers ks.s. price
territory than Wave-c
4. Wave-e must be smaller than wave-d (see Figure 5-37, previous page).
Central Considerations 5-29
b. Irregular Variation
This type of Triangle implies slightly greater "thrust" and velocity potential than a Horizontal
Triangle. The key element in the formation of an Irregular Triangle is the b-wave. It must be longer
than wave-a. The parameters below should be obeyed by market action to indicate an Irregular Triangle
has formed:
1. Wave-b should not be more than 261.8% of wave-a and will usually be less than 161.8%. An
exact Fibonacci relationship between wave-a and wave-b of any Triangle is very unusual.
2. Waves c, d, & e must all be smaller than the previous wave.
3. The trendlines of the Triangle should move in opposite directions.
c. Running Variation
This is among the most misinterpreted patterns of the Wave Theory. It compares with the confusion
associated with Double Three Running corrections. The important features of a Running Triangle are:
1. Wave-b is longer than wave-a and is the longest wave of the Triangle.
2. Wave-c is smaller than wave-b.
3. Wave-dis larger than wave-c.
4. Wave-e is smaller than wave-d.
5. Both trendlines will slope upward or downward.
6. The "thrust" after the Triangle will be much larger than the widest leg of the Triangle,
sometimes as much as 261.8%, but no more.
II. Non-Limiting (specific)
There is very little difference between Contracting Non-Limiting and Contracting Limiting Triangles. All of the rules covered above should apply, except for the following subtle differences that set
the two patterns apart. This listing is completely original, developed by the author after years of
observing and carefully quantifying triangular behavior.
1. Channeling - a Non-Limiting Triangle will behave slightly different around the converging
trendlines than a Limiting Triangle. The behavior occurs in one of three variations, all of which
are noticeably different from Limiting action:
a. The most common and distinguishing Non-Limiting action is congestion right into, or very
near the apex point of the converging trendlines. "Right into, or very near" is quantified by the
following calculation. Measure the time consumed by the triangle from its beginning to the end
of wave-e. If the converging trendlines occur before 20% of that time ( added to the end of wavee) has elapsed, that defines the above quoted statement.
b. Measuring the time distance from the beginning of the Triangle to the end of wave-e, if the
apex point of the converging trendlines occurs after 40% of that time has elapsed, it should, again,
-be considered a Non° Limiting Triangle.· This-is harder to anticipate since the Triangle formation
is not quite as obvious.
c. The last way a Non-Limiting Triangle can signal its existence is by a post-thrust correction
into the apex's time zone of the converging trendlines. In a Limiting Triangle, the time wne
occupied by the apex point is where the "thrust" generally concludes* (unless the thrust forms
into a Terminal pattern). The most common way for a Correction to retrace into the apex point
of the recent Triangle is for the thrust, out of the Triangle, to be ~ violent, reaching its initial
5-30 Central Consideradons
price length (based on the widest wave of the Triangle) well before the apex time period occurs. This
allows the market to correct back into the time period of the apex point until time "runs out" during the
apex time zone.
If any one of the above three situations arises toward the end of, or immediately after, the formation
of a Triangle, the Triangle should be considered Non-Limiting in nature.
Post-Triangular Thrust
The "thrust" distance out of a Non-Limiting Triangle is not confined to any specific amount. It may
(and usually does) temporarily react when it has achieved a price length approximately equal to the
widest leg of the Triangle, but that is generally short-lived. The move will then usually resume in the
direction of the original thrust and go for a distance which can only be determined by examining the larger
patterns under formation.
**Expanding Triangles (general)**
Expanding Triangles are most common during very large Complex Corrections. They are created
when five Corrective phases occur in a row with !llQS! or all of the segments, from left to right, covering
more price territory than the previous. The word "most," underlined in the last sentence, was used based
on the observation that frequently one (and possibly two during Running Expanding Triangles) of the
segments in an Expanding Triangle will be smaller than the previous (Figure 5-41, next page).
The general rules which apply to all Expanding Triangle formations are as follows:
1. The a-wave or the b-wave will always be the smallest segment of the Triangle.
2. Wave-e will almost always be the largest wave of the pattern.
3. Expanding Triangles cannot occur as b-waves in Zigzags orb c or d-wayes of a larger Triangle.
4. Thee-wave will usually be the most time consuming and complex segment of the Triangle. The
most typical construction of the e-wave (if you can see any subdivisions), would be a Zigzag (in
small Expanding Triangles), or a Complex Combination of corrections in larger patterns.
5. Thee-wave will almost always break beyond the trendline drawn across the top of wave-a and
wave-c.
6. The b-d trendline should function the same as it would in any Contracting Triangle.
7. The "thrust" out of an Expanding Triangle should be less than the widest wave of the Triangle
(which, in this case, is wave-e) unless it concludes a powerful, larger Correction.
8. Backward from wave-e, three of the previous waves must be at least 50% of the wave to the right.
Just like Contracting Triangles, Expanding Triangles divide into two distinct categories; Limiting
and Non-Limiting. The same category names were used to keep things as simple as possible, but unlike
their Contracting counterparts, the two terms do. not have any significant post-triangular implications.
[ As stated above in Rule #7, the "breakout" of an Expanding Triangle is less than the widest segment of
the Triangle.] The terms Limiting and Non-Limiting under this formation merely indicate whether the
Triangle is in a ~ wave position or part of a more elaborate Correction involving multiple
formations connected end to end.

The term Limiting always refers to 4th-wave orb-wave Triangles. Personally, I have never seen a
"4th-wave Expanding Triangle." It must logically be assumed they exist, but must be considered rare.
Of the few b-wave Expanding, Limiting Triangles witnessed, the following are the only descriptions
which seem to regularly apply:
1. A b-wave Expanding, Limiting Triangle appears to be possible only in an Irregular Failure or
C-Failure Flat pattern.
2. The "thrust" out of the Triangle is minimal, retracing approximately 61.8% of the Triangle from
highest to lowest point.
a. Horizontal Variation
A perfectly Horizontal Expanding Triangle is probably the least common way for an Expanding
formation to manifest itself. Why? It defies the natural tendency of a market to accumulate or distribute.
If you continually make new highs and new lows in a market, no trend is established. The market would
have to be in a state of Fundamental (as opposed to Technical) limbo. No large economic force pushing
the marketone'direciion of the other would be at work. That is a very unlikely position for a market to
be in, especially for long periods of time. As a personal assessment, the longer the period of time covered,
the more improbable the formation of a Horizontal Expanding Triangle becomes.
The parameters to create an Expanding Horizontal Triangle would be as such:
(1). Wave-a must be the smallest wave in the pattern.
(2). Wave-b, c, d, and e must each exceed the previous segment's termination point ( which may
or may notbe the highest or lowest price).
(3). The e-wave will probably break beyond the trendline drawn across wave-a & c.
5-32 Central Considerations
b. Irregular Variation
The Irregular Expanding Triangle is a little more common than the Horizontal type and is
characterized by several factors:
( 1 ). Either wave-bis smaller than wave-a and all the rest of the waves are larger than the previous,
or wave-d is smaller than wave-c and all the other waves are larger than the previous.
(2). The longer the period of time covered by the pattern, the more likely the channeling of the pattern
will be upwardly or downwardly skewed.
c. Running Variation
The Running Triangle has a trending appearance which is created by both wave-b being slightly
larger than wave-a and wave-d being slightly shorter than wave-c. Instead of the trendlines going in
opposite directions, they both go in the same direction, but still diverge. Thee-wave in this type of pattern
can be quite violent. Another variation occurs when all waves are larger than the previous except wavec (which is shorter than wave-b).
II. Non-Limiting (specific)
The Non-limiting Expanding refers to Triangles which form within more complex formations. For
example, the first or last phase of a Correction involving one or more x-waves could have as one of its
components a Non-Limiting Expanding Triangle. This is due to Rule #7 (page 5-31 ), which generally
states that the "thrust" out of an Expanding Triangle does not follow the same guidelines required of
Contracting Triangles. Since the "breakout" should not be as large as the width of the Expanding
Triangle ( wave-e ), obviously the "thrust" cannot start a major new advance or decline. This is an ideal
situation for an x-wave to develop. The "thrust" out of the Non-Limiting Expanding Triangle will usually
be an x-wave, but it could be the 5th wave of a Terminal or the second x-wave of a Triple Three or Triple
Combination.
Non-Limiting Expanding Triangles will be formed in the same manner as Limiting Expanding
Triangles with one exception regarding the apex point (which is backward in time). Measure the time
consumed by the entire Triangle then take 40% of that amount and subtract it (i.e. go backward in time)
from the beginning of wave-a. The apex will occur before the 40% time frame is reached. Usually it
will be reached within 20% of the larger time frame.

Conditional Construction Rules - Corrections

Alternation
Price
The price relations in a Correction are one of the least useful applications of the Rule of Alternation.
Why? The vast majority of waves in Corrections will be close to the same price length. When the Rule
is applied to Corrections, it has its greatest usefulness in ZigZags. The a-wave and b-wave of a ZigZag
should alternate in price. Wave-b will be 61.8% or less of wave-a. That is about the extent of Price
Alternation in Corrective patterns. The Intricacy and Construction aspects of Alternation (presented on
page 5-5) should also be considered at this time if your correction is composed of monowaves and
polywaves (or higher).
Time
The Rule of Time Alternation assumes full force in Corrective patterns. To apply correctly, three
adjacent corrective phases must be compared. The first two patterns will normally be very different in
time duration. The first pattern may take "n" number of time units while the second one takes n(l.618
or greater) Qin(.618 or less) number of time units. The third segment of the group will either be equal
to one of the previous two segments, relate to one of them by 61.8% or 161.8% OR equal the total time
consumed by both previous patterns combined. For more detail on this subject, refer to the "Time Rule"
section. NOTE: When dealing with polywaves that consume only three time units, Alternation of time
is impossible. Lack of time Alternation is a warning there may be a better way to arrange the monowaves
, but if it appears correct, it can be used as a legitimate pattern.

From this point onward, the rules covered in this section concerning Corrections develop in one of
two directions:
1. The rules get more subtle, conditional and difficult to apply, requiring lots of experience;
w:
2. They become less reliable, where they serve more as a reinforcement for an interpretation than
as a critical deciding factor.
As your analytical skills increase, there are additional considerations which will improve your realtime accuracy and forecasting ability. It is recommended that the beginning student stop at this point and
reread the earlier sections of the book, study, practice and commit to memory all of the rules and
techniques covered up to this point. The rest of the book is dedicated to more complex discussions of
market behavior. There is no need to go through the more difficult sections until you are comfortable
with your knowledge of the basics.
5-34 Central Considera#ons
Channeling
In channeling Corrections, the important point of reference is the b-wave. For Zigzags and Flats,
always draw a trendline from the start of wave-a to the end of wave-b ( called the 0-B trendline ). A parallel
line should be drawn across the termination of wave-a. If the pattern you are working with is a ZigZag,
the c-wave may break beyond or stay away from the parallel trendline, but it should not touch it. If it
does, it indicates the ZigZag will be part of a more complex correction, such as a Double, Triple
Combination or Double, Triple ZigZag pattern (for details on this concept, refer to page 9-3). Once the
0-B trendline is broken, the c-wave (and the larger pattern) is~ over. For Triangles, the trendline
is drawn across the end of wave-b and wave-d. When the B-D trendline is broken, the Triangle is
probably over. More advanced Channeling techniques are covered in Chapter 12.
Fibonacci Relationships
Fibonacci relationships are among an array of "final touch" formation tests which help to solidify a
proposal. Almost all Elliott patterns have their own unique combination ofFibonacci Relationships. This
is one of the more difficult aspects of the Theory since there are a multitude of relationship possibilities.
First, relationships are dependent on which general Correction category the market is in. Then, each
Corrective variation has its own subtle differences (advanced Fibonacci concepts are discussed in
Chapter 12).
Below is a listing of each "standard" Corrective category. Under each heading is a description of
which waves generally relate in a particular pattern. After each heading, a more specific breakdown is
given of the unique relationships usually associated with each Corrective variation.
a. · Elam (3-3-5)
Of all Corrective patterns, Flats are least likely to display Fibonacci relationships since each wave
is approximately equal to the previous one. When the b-wave of a Flat is much smaller or much larger
than wave-a, then relationships can start to appear. Below is a basic listing of whatto expect. [For a more
detailed rundown of Fibonacci relationships, refer to "Advanced Fibonacci Relationships" Chapter 12.]
Strong b-wave
When the b-wave exceeds the end of wave-a, it would basically be limited to a 138.2% (not a true
Fibonacci ratio, but a combination of two separate ones - 1.00 & .382) or 161.8% relationship, but neither
may be reached. Usually, if the b-wave is longer than wave-a, especially if it is substantially longer,
wave-a & c will be nearly equal in price. If the c-wave did relate by a Fibonacci ratio to wave-a, the ratio
would be 161.8% or 61.8%.
Normal b-wave
This is the Flat pattern least likely to exhibit Fibonacci relationships. The only possibility for
relationships would occur if the c-wave failed or elongated. If it failed, it is highly probable the c-wave
would relate to wave-a by 61.8%. On very rare occasions, wave-c can relate to wave-a by 38.2%, but
that is the minimum requirement.
If the c-wave Elongates, it is not likely there will be any relationship between wave-a & c. If there
is, it would have to be 161.8% or 261.8%.
Central Cons/deraOons 5-35
Weakb-wave
This situation allows for the greatest possible number of Fibonacci relationships. If wave-a and
wave-b related, it would be by 61.8%. Waves-a & c could relate by the same amount (Internally or
Externally, refer to page 12-22 for details). The c-wave could also be 61.8% of wave-b. '
b. ~(5-3-5)
Since tllere are not many ZigZagvariations ( compared to those possible in Flats and TrilUlgles), there
are only a few relational possibilities. -
Normal
Fibonacci relationships between adjacent waves of a pattern cannot be strictly depended upon. If
waves-a & b do relate, it will be by 61.8% or 38.2%. The more reliable relationships will occur between
waves-a & c. Wave-a will be either 61.8%, 100% or 161.8% of wave-c (either Internally or Externally,
see "Advanced Fibonacci Relationships," page 12-22 for details).
Elongated
When a ZigZag is given the title, "Elongated," it means the c-wave is excessively long in relation to
wave-a. Usually an Elongated c-wave will have no relation to wave-a; if it does, it will be by 261.8%.
Truncated
The only relationship likely in a Truncated Zigzag is between wave-a and wave-c. Wave-c would
be 38.2% of wave-a.
c. Triangles (3-3-3-3-3)
Triangles are composed of more wave segments than any other "standard" Elliott Correction. As a
result, they have a high probability of exhibiting multiple Fibonacci relationships. As a matter of fact,
a Contracting Triangle without Fibonacci relationships should be considered impossible. The normal
way Fibonacci relations m1U1ifest themselves i~ Triangle~ js_the same way they u~ually happe11in '!lost

or 38.2% and the b & d-waves to relate by 61.8%. The only two adjacent waves which will consistently
relate to each other by a Fibonacci ratio (usually .618) are waves-d & e.
Important Note: If wave-bis 61.8% of wave-a, you are probably not in a Triangle.
5-36 Central ConsideraUons
Degree
Looking back at your chart, if you are working with monowaves, transform the plain Corrective
symbols you have been using on your chart pattern into the specific symbol which represents SubMinuette Degree (a-b-c-d-e-x). With all Monowave patterns, start off by labeling each segment SubMinuette degree. If you are beyond the monowavedevelopment stage, the Degree Symbols used for the
current pattern will be dictated by combining the smaller patterns (which have already been carefully
analyzed and labeled) into larger Elliott patterns. How is this done? Generally, three patterns ofone
degree form to make one Corrective pattern of one larger degree (Triangles being the exception since
they require five segments to complete the. Correction of one larger Degree). Taking three Minor Degree
patterns and combining them into one larger Elliott pattern raises the Degree of that pattern one level.
The three Minqrlabels will be replaced with one Intermediate label. [For a more complete discussion
of Degree, refer to "More on Degree" on page 7-11 of Chapter 7.J

s fire tl,o bo~Miog of thi, book. the main foc"' Im, bee, on expioi,ring the step-by-step
process of proper monowave detection and the assemblage of monowave groups into Standard Elliott
polywave patterns. Each chapter and heading was organized in a very logical way to allow objective,
methodical application of the Rules to real-time price action. As your understanding of the Wave Theory
expands, the implementation of more sophisticated Rules and techniques is necessary to correctly
manage larger wave formations.
The last seven chapters of this book have been broadly titled The Neely Extensions. This is not to
be confused with the term "extension" which is the longest wave of an Impulse pattern. In this context,
the term "extensions" is used to indicate the presentation of new, but essential techniques and concepts
developed by the author which you should use when constructing wave patterns. Not every item
mentioned over the next seven chapters is completely new. A few ideas which have previously been
presented publicly are noted appropriately. Some previously known concepts have been greatly
expanded upon. Most of the ideas to follow, however, are completely new and should be very helpful
as you gain experience as an Elliott Wave analyst. Due to the prevalence of information now available
on this subject (books, newsletters, etc.), it is possible that concepts presented here may have, at
sometime, been presented before. If so, the previous presentation of that information is completely
unknown to the author.
From this point forward, the concepts and techniques for analyzing market behavior get more
involved and subtle. Many of the Rules, observations and tests require some knowledge of what the
market did before the current pattern and what it has done since the pattern completed. Until you are
comfortable with the construction of polywaves (and associated Rules), it is suggested you review the
previous sections and practice the Rules presented on real-time market action.
To give you a "taste" of what is to follow, some of the important topics covered in the rest of this book
are: discussions on the finalization and confirmation of polywave patterns; the reduction of polywaves
to simpler, more manageable forms; the ranking of polywaves based on Complexity level; the grouping
of polywaves (using Progress Labels) into larger, Standard or Non-Standard Elliott formations; the
Integration of several polywaves to form a multiwave ( or Non-Standard polywave) pattern, and much,
much more. If you learned a lot from the first five Chapters of "Mastering Elliott Wave," the next seven
are even more informative.

of Elliott Wave Theory
An important test of the validity of an interpretation involves the integration of Logic Rules. The
Logic Rules have evolved from years of diligent market observation by the author. The Rules require
all market action conform to specific behavior based on the implications of the pattern which preceded
it. The expected behavior must be present or there is a flaw in your current interpretation ( these flaws
can sometimes be explained if the pattern or market environment allows for exceptions; see Exception
Rule, page 9-7). In other words, all action must be accounted for, it must logically integrate with its
surroundings and post-pattern behavior must meet specific requirements.
If you have been following along with your own price chart, at this point the Post-Constructive
Rules of Logic will need to be employed (more advanced rules are discussed under the "Advanced
Logic Rules" Chapter I 0). Deciding which Rules to apply is a result of the type of pattern developing,
Impulsive or Corrective. Refer to the appropriate heading now if you are analyzing your own chart,
otherwise just read straight through.

Two Stages of Pattern Confirmation
Stage 1 - Break 2-4 Trendline
The first point to apply the Logic Rules is immediately after an Impulse pattern finishes. Draw a
trendline across the end of waves (2) and (4). To confirm whether the Impulse pattern you discovered
is authentic, post-Impulsive market action must break the 2-4 trendline in the same amount of time
consumed by the 5th wave or less (see Figure 6-1 ). If it takes more time, the 5th wave is developing into
a Terminal or wave-4 is not complete or your Impulse interpretation is wrong.

Stage 2 · 5th Wave Retracement Requirements
Next, check to see which wave of the Impulse pattern Extended. Depending on which wave is the
Extension, price action will return to a support/resistance level defined by the price range of wave-2 or
wave-4 of the Impulse pattern. Soon to follow is a list of minimum and maximum retracement
expectations based on which Impulse variation took place.
1st Wave Extension
The retracement to follow this Impulse variation must return to the termination of wave-4. Elliott
said it usually will return to the price zone of wave-2. This is the case when the 1st Extension is waveI or wave-5 of a larger Impulsive pattern. If the 1st Extension is wave-3, price action (depending on
conditions) may not be able to return to the 2nd wave zone. If the market moves beyond the termination
· of wave-2, the whole Impulse pattern ended an even larger Impulsion or Correction.
3rd Wave Extension
Price action must return to the 4th wave zone of the completed Impulse pattern and will usually end
near the termination of wave-4. If the move retraces more than 61.8% of the entire pattern, the 3rd
Extension Impulse-also completed an Impulse wave·of one higher degree.
5th Wave Extension
The correction to follow a 5th extension pattern must retrace at least 61.8% of the 5th wave, but must
not retrace all of the 5th wave if the trend is to remain in effect. If the 5th extension~ get completely
retraced, it indicates the extension terminated a larger trend. Here are the different ways that can happen:
6-2 Basic Rules of Logic
1. The 5th Extension pattern was part of a larger Impulse which was also a 5th Extension;
w:
2. The 5th Extension was the c-wave of a Flat or Zigzag pattern.
5th Wave Failure
A 5th wave Failure occurs when wave-5 is shoner than wave-4. This situation implies a great deal
of counter trend power. If the 5th wave failed in your wave group, the move to follow should completely
retrace the entire Impulse wave. If the Impulse was moving upward (downward), there should be no new
highs (lows) in the market until the Impulse is completely retraced.
If the price action l!fu;r the Impulse pattern did not conform to the above, applicable behavior
requirements, something is wrong with your interpretation. Changes in the Progress Labels used will
probably need to occur. Possibly, reinstituting the entire wave identification and Structural labeling
process of the waves on your chart will be required (if so, return to Chapter 3).
A Word of Warning: If market action has, up to this point, followed all the necessary rules for
Impulse formation, do not be quick to throw out your entire count when one factor does not develop as
expected. Generally, a~ change in the Progress Labels will put the entire count back on track. The
most frequent reason the market will not follow through after breaking the 2-4 trendline is because the
4th wave is not actually complete (under Channeling in Chapter 5, see "Wave-4" for an explanation of
this process and Localized Progress Label Changes on page 12-45 for a more complete description of
how to make alterations of a scenario without destroying the whole interpretation).

Reg,uirements for Pattern Confirmation
Unlike Impulse patterns, the confirmation of a Correction tkJes not require a sequential unfolding of
specific retracement events. The order of the confirmation stages depends on whether wave~b is shoner
or longer than wave-a in the Correction. Since Complex Corrections terminate with Standard Elliott
patterns, the only requirement to confirm that a Complex Correction has ended is to confirm the Standard
Correction which terminates the Complex Correction. Complete confirmation of a pattern always
involves two Stages. If the confirmation of both Stages occurs, there is virtually no doubt of the
authenticity of the Correction on your chart. If only one of the Stages passes inspection the pattern can
still be legitimate, but consider it a warning and be on the look out for more appropriate possibilities. See
the description (below) for the Corrective category"you are currently studying.
Flats and Zigzags
Wave-b Shorter than Wave-a
Under these conditions, draw a trendline across the beginning of wave-a and the l<llil. of wave-b. To
satisfy Stage 1 and confirm the authenticity of the Correction, post-Corrective market_ action must~
the "0-B" trendline in the same amount of time (or less) that wave-c took to form. If1t takes more ttme,
Basic Rules of Logic 6-3
the c-wave is developing into a Terminal or wave-4 (of wave-c) is not complete or your Corrective
interpretation is incorrect. If Stage 1 confirmation is met, Stage 2 requires wave-c be completely retraced
in the same amount of time ( or less) that wave-c took to form. In Figure 6-2, the b-wave was intentionally
drawn so that it related to wave-a by 61.8%; this allows the one diagram to dually function as an
illustration of how Flat confirmation and Zigzag confirmation occurs.

In this situation, Stage 1 Confirmation is met if wave-c is completely retraced in the same amount
of time (or less) that it took to form. Stage 2 Confirmation is satisfied if the market breaks the 0-B
trendline in the same amount of time (or less) that wave-c took to form (see Figure 6-3). The larger the
b-wave, the more the market will have difficulty attaining this second Stage of Confirmation. Therefore,
be lenient on the time factor for Stage 2 during Run,ning Corrections and Irregular Failures with very large
b-waves. ·
Triangles
There are two Triangular categories, "Expanding" and "Contracting." Contracting Triangles can
easily be confirmed based on post-Triangular market behavior. Expanding Triangles confirm their
legitimacy through "non-confirmation." In other words, after thee-wave of an Expanding Triangle, the
market should either not retrace thee-wave completely.(obviously simultaneously eliminating the
chance to break the B-D trendline) or it will take more time to completely retrace wave-e than wave-e
took to form. Below are listed the two, sequential Stages of confirmation for a Contracting Triangle.
Stage I
In Triangles, a B-D trendline is implemented instead of a 0-B. To obtain confirmation, the market
must break the B-D trendline in the same amount of time (or less) as that consumed by wave-e.
6-4 Basic Rules of Logic

The "thrust" after wave-e of a Triangle should exceed the highest or lowest price level achieved
during the Triangle. [This concept has already been discussed in Chapter 5, page 5-28.] The Triangle's
"thrust" must terminate in a time frame which is less than 50% of that taken by the Triangle (NonLimiting Triangles are not bond to the 50% time rule) added to the end of wave-e.
All Elliott Wavt patterns imply certain levels of strength or weakness (see Pattern Implications
under the Advanced Rules of Logic heading, Chapter 10). When a pattern completes, the market must
react in a fashion which is consistent with the implications of that pattern. For example, if a Running
Correction just completed, the move afterward needs to be~ explosive (upward or downward) and
achieve a price distance equal to or greater than 16t8% of the wave (or wave group) preceding the
Running Correction. To view diagrams of Running Corrections, see Realistic Representations, pages
5-38 and 5-39.
How will you know what to expect from other types of patterns? Multiple Corrective categories and
numerous variations of each category preclude a !i.mJ;!k discussion on this subject in Chapter 6. If you
are at a more advanced level and feel ready to learn some new concepts, study the Advanced Rules of
Logic in Chapter 10.
If you do not"feeheady to tackle a new section, simply continue applying the more simplistic
approaches outlined in this and previous chapters, but keep trying to form your wave pattern's with the
logical concept in mind. Put another way, do not allow a weak Corrective pattern to precede a strong
move or a strong Correction to occur before a weak move. That condition would produce a contradiction
in the pattern's implications and virtually guarantee the interpretation is incorrect. With practice and keen
observation, the concept will become easier to apply.

By meticulously following all the steps from Preliminary Analysis up to the Central Considerations section and carefully monitoring the effects of the Post-Constructive Rules of Logic, you should
know whether the combination of waves you have been testing (since the beginning of Chapter 3) are
Impulsive or Corrective in nature. It should also be relatively evident which Elliott pattern variation is
unfolding. As a result of this testing, there should be little doubt as to the validity of the formation. Now
that you have identified a legitimate Elliott pattern, most of the pattern management procedures are
behind you. There are only a few more things to cover:
1. How is your completed pattern simplified to make it easier to work with in the future?
il.Wl
2. How is the Degree Title and Symbol of that simplified pattern decided upon?
To answer the first question, the Compaction Process is used. Compaction allows you to simplify
a pattern's Structure Series into its base Structure (simply either a ":3" or a ":5"). Using the Complexity
Rule, a technique developed by the author, the base Structure has to be "stratified" contingent on the
intricacies of the segments which made up the compacted pattern. This technique will greatly assist in
the proper combining oflarge scale and complex formations as your skills develop. To answer the second
question, the "More On Degree" heading at the end of this Chapter will enable you to deduce the proper
Degree Title and Symbol of each pattern co01pacted.
Compaction Procedures
IUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
"Compaction" is a term used to describe an essential, heretofore undefined, Elliott process. It is a
. __ technique employed to reduce a completed series of Mono-, Poly-, Multi-, or Macrowaves into a single
Impulsive or Corrective structure (":3" or ":5"). Due to the dynamic nature of this concept; any
completed Elliott pattern, no matter how large or small, can be handled as and labeled as a single
Corrective (:3) or Impulsive (:5) event. This process is necessary to continually simplify what would
eventually become an unmanageable web of price action. The technique cannot be employed until after
all previously discussed criteria has been considered (i.e., Structure, Series identification, Essential and
Conditional Construction Rules, Channeling, Fibonacci ratios, Post-Constructive Rules of Logic, etc.).
Once all basic Rules and procedures have been followed, the Compaction process is implemented.
Conclusions 7-1
Below is a listing of how to reduce all Elliott formations based on their Structure Series.
A. 5-3-5-3-5 =
B. 5-3-5 =

Zigzag= ":3"
Flat= ":3"
Triangle= ":3"
Terminal Impulse= ":5"
F. All patterns which contain "x-waves"
(immediately before Compaction is
performed) can be reduced to a ":3."
Upon completion of a correctly formed Elliott pattern, the Structure Series which makes up the
pattern can be compacted into the single number (the base Structure label) on the right of each Series.
If you are diligent in the practice of Compaction, the larger and longer-term patterns can be put together
with the same, and sometimes greater, ease as the shorter-term patterns.
Below is an example of a Standard wave pattern being Compacted into a single Structure label (see
Figures 7-1 and 7-2).

The new Structure sequence, due to implementation of the recently Compacted pattern's
base value, creates two possible Series for
consideration:
a. 5 - F3 -15 - F3 -LSI Zigzag Series
b. !S - F3 - 5 - F3 - LS! Impulse Series
After checking all necessary criteria, if conditions typical to the
pattern being studied are met, its Structure Series is replaced with that
pattern's Compacted base Structure. When attempting to combine the
Compacted pattern with surrounding market action, the base Structure
should be used for all Series Combinations from that time onward.
In the diagram, the F3-c3-L5 which makes up the Flat is compacted to a ":3." {level-I Complexity). That ":3." should be used in new
Structure Series' which will form even larger formations.
Note: After Compaction, reassessment of that pattern's base Structure is required. Return to
Chapter 3 and pretend the Compacted pattern is a monowave. Apply the necessary Rules to detect the
groups internal Structure. If this produces a base Structure contrary to the pattern's nature (Class), a
"missing" wave may exist. Note that, then reassess the two monowaves (or wave groups) on either side
of the Compacted pattern. Afterward, proceed to Chapter 4 and resume normal analysis protocol.
(Warning: do not reassess patterns which exceed their own beginning; for details see page 3-68 ).
Regrouping
After Compaction, the wave group• s base Structure (with the assistance of Chapter 4) will be used
to form larger Standard or Non-Standard Structure Series'.
For example: The group ofmonowaves in Figure 7-1 has already been Structurally labeled. After
making the proper observations and applying the appropriate tests, you decide the Flat pattern uncovered
in Figure 7-1 is legitimate; therefore, it is compacted to produce a base Structure of ":3." When you return
to Chapter 3, larger patterns may be formed by taking the base Structure of that pattern and combining
it with Structure labels of surrounding patterns (which, themselves, may or may not have been through
the Compaction process). Before searching for a new Structure Series, make sure there are at least five
Structurally labeled wave segments to analyze. After Compacting the Flat in Figure 7-1, only three
Structure Labels remained. Therefore, two additional monowaves were added to Figure 7-2. In Figure
7-2, moving backward from the ":L5" at the top of the wave group, only the compacted value of the
recently found Flat should be used as part of this new Structure Series.
Integration
Integration is a term used to describe the transference of shorter-term, compacted wave Structure
to longer-term charts allowing larger formations to slowly be pieced together. For example, if every time
a polywave pattern completed on a shorter-term chart you were to place that pattern and its compacted
Structure label on a slightly longer-term chart, eventually numerous polywaves would be present, each
with its own base Structure identified. Combining those polywaves into larger formations would involve
exactly the same procedures described for monowaves. Only a few additional Structure Series
possibilities, which are covered in the next chapter (Construction of Complex Polywaves, Multi waves,
or higher), would need to be considered.
Another application of the Integration concept would include the cross-referencing of information
(i.e., comparing price/time projections of long and short-term charts to arrive at a consensus projection)
between charts to arrive at the most logical and accurate assessment of the future course of a market.
Through a process of elimination and through the cross-referencing of target zones and time projections
you can usually reduce the number of interpretation possibilities to a single choice. At the very least,
you should be able to decrease the number choices and keep your trading with the trend of the market.
Progress Labels - revisited
In the process of transferring Structural information from a shorter to longer-term chart, do not
transfer the Progress Labels associated with the pattern. Why not? Progress labels serve a very specific
and short-lived purpose. They solidify and confirm (or invalidate) your grouping of several adjacent
mono-, poly-, multi-, or macrowaves by providing a list of necessary attributes which must be adhered
to by the market action. They are an essential part of the procedures leading up to the Compaction
Conclusions 7-3
process. After a pattern meets all necessary attributes and has been properly Compacted, the Progress
Labels (1-2-3-4-5 or a-b-c, etc.), which organized the market action into an Elliott formation, no longer
serve an important function to the pattern. The base Structure (:3 or :5) is now the most important
consideration. It is the base Structure which properly guides you in the formation of larger Complex
Polywave or Multiwave patterns.
Complexity Rule
1111110011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I I I I
This Rule, another tool developed by the author, provides a standard for the categorization of
subdivisions within a pattern. It assists in combining Iariw scale patterns and in deciding the relative
Degree Title of a segment. As patterns get larger and more time consuming, it can be difficult to know
which patterns can and cannot be combined with others to form larger ones (a function of Degree).
Basically, all analysis begins with the combining of monowaves into polywaves, those polywaves into
multi waves, etc. As you progress, each pattern ( visually and structurally) gets more difficult to manage
if you do not keep track of the Complexity level of each pattern, before and after Compaction.
Complexity is not an important concept to understand when you are just beginning your studies of
the Elliott Wave Theory, but it will become increasingly important as you begin to chart and keep track
of long-term wave patterns. Complexity identification plays an important role in the detection of large
scale patterns of the same Degree. Generally, patterns only of the same or of an adjacent Complexity
Level can be considered the same Degree (Degree is explained in greater detail later in this Chapter).
In the early stages of market development, the Complexity Level of a pattern is relatively easy to
ascertain. It is a direct product of the number of subdivisions visible in a price move. A single mono wave
has a Complexity Level of "O" (see Figure 7-3). Arranging three m: five monowaves into a polywave
constitutes the development of a pattern from its base leveLof Complexity to Level-I (see Figure 7-5a).
Level-2 is the point where one of the Trending patterns in a polywave noticeably divides into a smaller
Impulse sequence, turning the polywave into a multiwave.
The detection of Complexity Level-3 (and higher) patterns is not quite so obvious. A larger pattern's
Complexity Level is almost solely dependent upon the Complexity of smaller Impulse segments within
the pattern. The "Complexity identification" techniques will keep you on track when attempting to
combine patterns of extended price and time characteristics. For example, you cannot expect the straight
line in Figure 7-4a (below left) to be of the same degree as the pattern in Figure 7-4b (below right). That
is, of course, an obvious example. When a pattern covers several months or several years, the Complexity
Level can be very difficult to discover without implementing the techniques to follow. The next few
pages describe how Complexity Level is arrived at on varying scales of market activity.
Figure 7-4a Figure7-4b

These two patterns -
"'' 0 ill' '------ cannot be considered .._.. the same degree.
7-4 Conclusions
Monowaves
The Complexity Level of a monowave is easy to determine. With no visible subdivisions, the
Complexity Level of a monowave is always "O." When it comes to integrate monowaves in the
Complexity evaluation process, assign all monowaves a mathematical value of "O."
Figure 7-3
Poly waves
Anytime a market completes an Elliott pattern which has visible subdivisions and conforms to all
applicable rules, the Complexity Level must automatically be Level-I or greater. In other words,
anything greater in Complexity than a monowave is of Complexity Level-I or higher. The Complexity
Level of a pattern is designated by the presence (or absence) of underlines to existing Structure Labels
( the greater the number of underlines, the higher the Complexity Level of the pattern completed). No
underlines indicate Level-0. One underline stands for Complexity Level-I, two underlines, Complexity · V"ff&1ll4illl,
Level-2, etc.
A simple Polywave is composed of only three or five monowaves. In Figure 7-5a, two simple
polywaves (one Corrective, one Impulsive) are diagramed which fall under typical Elliott guidelines.
Since both patterns subdivide, they must immediately be given a Complexity rating of Level-1. To
confirm whether the pattern is or is not of greater Complexity, it is necessary to investigate the Impulsive

segments of the move and pick the segment of greatest Complexity. In Figure 7-Sa, all the Impulse
patterns (:S's) are monowaves. Monowaves, as mentioned earlier, are Level-0. This value would be
added to the assumed Level-I rating. The final result; both patterns in Figure 7-Sa are Level-I.

and left are monowaves

Monowaves
Strictly due to visible subdivision, both of the above patterns automatically must be of Complexity Level 1 or higher.
To make sure there is no misunderstanding, several additional examples are needed. In Figure 7-
Sb (the bottom of this page and the top of the next), both patterns are of Complexity Level-I. Even though
Corrective segments within each pattern subdivided (wave-bin the Flat and waves 2 & 4 in the Impulse
pattern), the Complexity Level of the Impulse segments of those patterns remained at Level-0. This
means the Complexity of the entire move is still Level-I.

7-S Conclusions
Here, the "::1" is underlined once because it subdivides into three segments. Its Complexity Level
cannot be any greater than Level-I since no part contains an Impulse pattern which subdivides.
A subdivided Correction does not raise the Complexity of the larger pattern. To raise the Complexity
Levelofapatternalwaysrequiresa~":5."
If a pattern contains an Impulse segment, simply add
the Complexity Level of the most complex Impulse
pattern to its automatic Level-I Complexity.
Since the formation on the left does contains an
Impulse pattern, and that segment exhibits Level-0
Complexity, add Level-0.to the automatic Level-I
and the result is still Level-I.

The same rules which guide the discovery of Complexity Level in Corrections applies to Impulse patterns which
have polywaves in the 2nd or 4th-wave position. Note here
that both Corrections are of Level-I, but none of the Impulse
advances subdivide. To arrive at the correct Complexity
Level, you immediately assume a Level-I rating simply
because there are visible subdivisions in the pattern. When
you check for the most complicated Impulse segment, all are
of Complexity Level-0. Adding that amount to the automatic
Level 1, you again arrive at Level I for the i:m move.
Multiwaves
All Multiwaves are Complexity Level-2 patterns. What is the major difference between a Polywave
and a Multi wave? In a Multi wave, at least one (and usually, only one) of the ":S's" within the multiwave
subdivides into its own Impulsive polywave (see Figure 7-6a). On rare occasions, and under specific
circumstances, more than one Impulsive polywave might occur in amultiwave. A Corrective Multi wave
is diagramed in Figure 7-6b (next page).

Referring to Figure 7-6c, this is how Complexity of that pattern would be decided. First, observe if
the pattern subdivides or not. It does, therefore it automatically qualifies for the minimum Complexity
rating of Level-1. Next, examine each individual Impulse segment and note the Complexity Level of
each. Out of the three Impulse patterns of the same Degree, choose the one with the highest Complexity
rating. The most complex segment in this pattern is the middle advance (wave-3), which is Level-I
Complexity. Add "l" to the automatic Level-1 and you get Level-2. That is the Complexity of the
diagram in Figure 7-6c. Figure 7-6d describes the Complexity delineation process for a Corrective
Multiwave.

7-8 Conclusions
The same principles used to decide Complexity
Level of a Correction are used for Impulse waves. In
the diagram, the visible subdivisions again indicate
a minimum Level-I rating. Noting the Complexity
of each individual segment of the Impulse wave, the
most complex Impulse wave is wave-3 (it isa ":l").
This Level-I pattern would be added to the
automatic Level-I. The result, a Level-2 rating for
the entire compacted pattern.
Figure7-6d
The Complexity Level is assumed to be at least
Level-I since there are visible subdivisions. Next,
note that the second Trending pattern is the highest
level of the two Impulsive patterns. The Level-I
Complexity of the final Impulse wave is added to
the automatic Level-I. Consequently, the Zigzag
is Complexity Level-2. Note: each underline
denotes an additional level of Complexity.

The entire formation would compact to the Complexity Level of the
most complex standard Elliott pattern. The second Zigzag is the most
complex standard pattern, so the rating of that Zigzag correction
(Level-2) would be the rating of the !mtim larger Complex Correction.
This Double Zigzag, when complete,
will need to be compacted to its base
structure(whichis ":3"), To maintain the
proper Complexity Level, assign the
whole correction the Complexity Level
of the most complicated, independent
Standard Elliott pattern. In this case, the
second Zigzag is the most complex and is
a Level-2 pattern. That would be the
assigned value of the whole formation.
Conclusions 7-9
Macrowaves
"Macrowave" is a less precise term than the previous three descriptions of market Complexity. As
greater periods of time elapse, a pattern gets more and more complicated. Visually, there is an undefined
point where it becomes very difficult to distinguish one Complexity Level from another. For this reason,
there was no need to continue naming moves of greater and greater Complexity. Therefore, the term
"Macrowave" will be used to describe any complex pattern above the Multi wave stage.
The minimum requirement fora pattern to fall into the Macrowave category is that it contains at least
one Multi wave and one Polywave (usually there will be two polywaves, see Figure 7-7). To derive ~he
Complexity Level of Figure 7-7, first use the "automatic" rule. The pattern should immediately be
considered of at least Level-I Complexity since subdivisions are visible. Examine each Impulsive
segment (of the same Degree) within the Macrowave. Choose the one with the highest rating and add
that to the automatic Level-I rating. In this case, the final advance is a Level-2 pattern. Add that to the
automatic Level-I and you get Level-3. Since this is the minimum Construction of a Macrowave, all
Macrowaves must have a Level-3 rating or higher.

More on Degree
lllllllllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
If you were to ask technicians their definition of Degree as it relates to the financial or agricultural
markets, most would probably use non-specific descriptions such as short-term, intermediate-term, and
long-term. Vaguely, they may describe how much time each Degree consumed (of course, from their
own perspective). What constitutes a long period of time for some may be a short period of time for the
more patient. This general description of Degree leaves a lot to be desired by the demanding technician
and serious market student.
Precise rules are necessary to discern every aspect of market behavior if you expect to make accurate
predictions. Having specific criteria for the evaluation of different Degree levels also aids in the discussion of a market, allowing you to speak about various types of price action with others from a common
vantage point. Knowing the relative Degree of a pattern is essential to the proper application of numerous
rules, the integration of information from a shorter to longer-term chart and the Compaction (discussed
earlier) of a completed pattern into its base Structure (:3 or :5).
Degree has been purposely skimmed over (until now) to prevent any confusion. A good foundation
of the more concrete concepts of the Elliott Wave Theory is required to properly understand Degree.
Degree is important if you are employing a combination of short, intermediate and long-term charts, not
when you are still learning to interpret and combine monowaves into polywaves.
Degre£ Titling
Degree is a concept which must be considered when you combine several (or more) Mono-, PolyMulti, or Macrowaves to form a larger Impulsive or Corrective pattern. The realization of this process
creates a higher Degree Title for the combined group of waves as a singular entity. In other words, when
three or five segments are combined into one larger, legitimate Elliott pattern, a pattern of one higher
Degree is created. Therefore, any visible subdivisions in a pattern are always at least of one lower Degree
than the pattern as a whole.
The Degree concept cannot take root until you finally Title a specific move on your chart. The Title
of a particular move is basically up to you, but some suggestions were given earlier to designate the
original monowaves on your first and smallest time frame chart as Sub-Minuette in Degree. Once a
segment is Titled, there is a frame of reference from which to compare all other patterns.
On the next page is a chronologically progressive listing of the Titles and Symbols which make up
the various wave Degrees. These Title listings are the same as those R. N. Elliott originally devised ( with
two additions by the author).

* Additions to Elliott's original titles
The Titles listed above represent progressively larger Degrees from the top downward. Beginning
at the top, the Titles are encased in larger and larger rectangles to show their increasing size. By stacking
the rectangles in pyramid fashion, it should provide you with a visual understanding of how each smaller
Degree pattern builds the foundation for the next larger Degree.
When is it necessary to use the additional Degree Titles at the top of the list? The Complexity of a
wave pattern expands and contracts as the time element allowed for its formation expands and contracts.
The Sub-Minuette Degree designation used on the monowaves of your original chart may eventually
represent patterns of increased complexity as time passes. The Sub-Minuette Title, which previously
denoted only monowaves, may eventually represent polywaves, also. This takes place when the market
expands the time element allowed to complete a formation of a specific Degree. The division of the SubMinuette pattern will require assigning each segment with a lower Degree Title. For each division, you
would employ the Micro symbols. If the Micro waves subdivide, use the Sub-Micro Titles and Symbols.
Degree Symbolizing
A Degree Symbol is the simultaneous representation of a Progres"s'Label (depicting pattern position),
and a Degree Title (which, in a relative manner, loosely describes a pattern's price and time parameters
and its intricacy relative to patterns of one larger and one smaller Degree).
On the next page is a repeat listing of all Degree Titles from the above diagram. This time, specific
Progress Label Symbols have been added to show which Degree Title the Symbols represent. The
Symbols in Figure 7-8 are not exactly like those Elliott used originally. A more logical labeling system
has been devised by the author to make memorization easier.

Review
For two ( or more) patterns to be combinable, they must be of the same Degree. Anytime an Elliott
pattern is assembled, it is automatically implied each segment is of the same Degree (but not necessarily
of the same Complexity). For two waves to be of the same Degree, it is imperative they possess some
similarities of Price and/or Time ( see "Rule of Similarity and Balance"; Chapter 4, page 3). Ideally, a
mixture of time and price similarities is present in waves of the same Degree. Realistically, when a same
degree wave is not similar in price, the market will compensate by closely matching ( or exceeding) the
time consumed by the previous move. If time is not within the relational range indicated in the "Rule
of Similarity ... " section, then price will adjust for the deficiency by closely matching ( or exceeding) that
of the previous wave. If neither the time nor the price c9nsumed by a wave falls within. the"relational
range" of an adjacent wave, the two waves are almost surely !!Q! of the same Degree.
Another method of detecting "same Degree" patterns involves Complexity Level. For patterns to
be considered the same Degree, they must be of the same Complexity or of an adjacent complexity.
[NOTE: an extremely rare exception to this statement may take place between the center portion of a
Triple Combination Correction and one or both of the x-waves which surround it.] This concept
becomes very helpful as the patterns being studied unfold beyond the 2nd or 3rd complexity level. It will
keep your patterns in proper relationship to each other and help avoid incorrect integration of patterns.
Conclusions 7-13
To begin your application of Degree labels, it is suggested the Sub-Minuette Title be used on the
monowaves of your smallest chart ( this should have already been done in the Chapter 5). After moving
to the Compaction section, the Degree of the compacted pattern will be one level above the Degree of
the highest Degree labels used before Compaction. This applies every time you compact a pattern. For
example, the first wave group you worked with ( or are working with) should have been composed of three
or five Sub-Minuette monowaves. After a group is compacted into a single Structure label, the pattern,
as a whole, would be elevated to Minuette Degree.

At the very beginning of the book, the term "wave" was described strictly from a Monowave
perspective. Not until the end of the Conclusion chapter could a more general description of the term
"wave" be given which encompasses patterns of every Degree (mono-, poly-, multi- and macrowave):
A .l!:'.a£t is the distance between two adjacent Progress Labels "of the same degree."
For example, the action between Progress Label's (1) and (2) or A and B, is a Wave. This differs
from the definition given earlier of the more specific monowave which was strictly limited to the motion
between one chani:e in price direction and the next. Now that you know the general definition of"wave,"
it should be clear why it was impossible to provide you with a general description earlier.

After identifying one or more Polywave patterns on a real-time price chart, to expand your
perspective of the market's future possibilities, you will need to combine a group of polywaves (to create
a Complex Polywave) or combine a combination of mono- and polywaves to create a Multi wave pattern.
Construction of Complex Polywaves
lllmllmlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I I I I
Complex Polywaves fall into two categories. The first category is the Standard type which is an Impulsive or Corrective pattern where the most subdivided wave is a Correctivepolywave only. Impulsive
. _polywaves are excluded.from the previous sentence because a p_.!lttern containing_an Impulsivepolywave
is a Multiwave pattern (or higher).
The other category of Complex Polywave is the Non-Standard type. Special rules must be obeyed
and certain circumstances must exist to create a Non-Standard pattern. Non-Standard patterns are only
possible when combining several polywaves ( or higher). They cannot simply occur from a combination
of uncompacted monowaves.
Standard Type
The formation of a Standard Impulsive or Corrective Polywave is not normally composed strictly
of three or five adjacent monowaves. Usually, one of the Corrective phases (but notllllX of the Impulsive
phases) of the polywave will itself be a polywave (see Figure 8-1 on page 8-4). This allows for better
Alternation between the two detached corrective phases of an lmm!!& pattern (i.e., waves 2 and 4) or
the two adjacent segments of a Corrective pattern (i.e., waves A and B).
Construction of Complex Po/ywaves, Multiwaves, etc_ 8-1
When a Polywave contains one or more Corrective Polywaves, it is considered a Complex
Polywave. For a pattern to remain a Complex Polywave, no segment labeled with a Structure of ":5" can
subdivide. If one or more of the ":S's" in a pattern does subdivide into a Polywave, the pattern should
be considered a Multi wave (refer to "Construction of Multiwaves," page 3-16).
Whether a Polywave is strictly composed of monowaves or one or two Corrective polywaves, all the
same Construction Rules covered in the Central Considerations chapter apply.
Non-Sta.ndard Type
The presence of a Non-Standard formation is only possible if there are at least two Corrective
polywave patterns (compacted to their base Structure of ":3") which are separated by a mono- or
polywave corrective phase. These base Structure labels serve the same combining function they did for
monowaves in Chapter 4, to assist you in the proper grouping of adjacent wave patterns.
Due to the more elaborate design of polywaves (relative to monowaves), they can interrelate with
other polywaves in ways not possible at the monowave level. For example, to detect the internal
Structure of a monowave requires observing how much surrounding market action retraces it. On the
other hand, when working with polywaves, the Structure is already known; there is no need to wait for
a reaction. This fact brings up additional interaction possibilities which are covered below.
Additional Retracement Rules
If you are following along with your own chart and see a confirmed, Compacted Corrective polywave
which is retraced less than 61.8%, or more than 161.8% by the next monowave or Corrective polywave,
and then another Corrective polywave occurs immediately thereafter, refer to the "*Specifications*"
section below for an explanation of what such an arrangement could mean and how to solidify such a
grouping into a legitimate Elliott formation.
If neither of the above relational circumstances is present in your polywave grouping, the grouping
should be considered of Standard design. If that is the case for your wave group, go to the "Standard"
heading on page 8-1, then move on to the Intermediary Observations chapter. Work with your
polywave group as if it were a monowave group; all the same Rules and procedures apply. The size of,
or time consumed by, a wave group has virtually no effect on how it is analyzed. Wave patterns lasting
several years will still subdivide into Flats, Triangles, Impulsions, etc. In working with such large
patterns, Structure Labels are the key to maintaining analytical perspective and formational integrity.
*Specifications*
All Non-Standard market action involves X-waves. An X-wave is a Corrective pattern (always)
which separates two Standard Elliott Corrections. Locating behavior indicative of X-waves is the key
to finding Non-Standard wave patterns.
How do you recognize X-wavebehavior? There are two important conditions towatch for.
Conditjon 1: The strongest signal of an X-wave developing in the market occurs when two
compacted Corrections (polywave or higher) are separated by an intervening Corrective wave
(monowave or higher and of Standard or Non-Standard nature) which retraced thef.ir.fil..Corrective phase
less than 61.8%. That intervening wave (the x-wave) will usually be of one lower Complexity Level
than the two Corrections which it separates.
8-2 Constroction of Complex Polywaves, Multiwaves, etc.
Condjtjon 2: If three Compacted polywave Corrections occur one after the next, with the second
Correction 161.8% (or more) of the first, the probabilities are very high the second Correction is an Xwave. In this situation, all Corrections will usually be of the same Complexity. If any one of the patterns
is of a higher Complexity, it will usually be the last Correction of the entire formation.
If you witness either one of the above Conditions, the market is probably creating a Non-Standard
formation. At that time it would be necessary to revert your Compacted poly- multi-, or macrowave
pattern back into its pre-compacted Structure Series [i.e., if the first Correction of the group was a Zigzag,
and you Compacted it to a "3," reverse the process and return it to its original ":5-:3-:5" condition.]
To continue with the analysis, note which of the two above conditions was met by your wave group.
If Condition-I was met, move on to the heading Complex Correction with Small x-Wave ("a." below).
If Condition-2 was met, go to the Complex Correction with Large X-Wave heading ("b." on page 8-11 ).
a. Complex Correction with Small x-Wave(s)
When a Non-Standard wave pattern unfolds, the chances are much greater the x-wave will be
smaller in price than the previous Corrective phase (less than 61.8% ). This Non-Standard variation will
often produce the look of an Impulse pattern, but close attention to detail should rule out that possibility
(for details, see Emulation and Missing Waves in Chapter 12).
Each Non-Standard wave pattern, depending on its Structure Series, is given a different name. Listed
below are the Non-Standard Structure Series Combinations which contain m!llll X-waves. Each
Combination listed has the pre-compacted Structure of each Corrective phase on the left. The entire
formation's compacted value is on the right (c.t. = "Contracting Triangle only"). On the far right are the
Figures which correlate to the formations on the left. In each Figure, a correct and incorrect interpretation
is provided to help you avoid misinterpretations when deciphering market action.

In each sequence above, the Structure of the x-wave is not revealed. This is done because X-waves
can be virtually any Corrective pattern without effecting the name or overall look of the larger formation.
An X-wave can even be a Non-Standard pattern when the time period covered by the two surrounding
patterns is long enough to allow for it. When reviewing the listing in Table B (page 8-11 ), keep in mind
that an X-wave will usually alternate its formation with the Corrective pattern which immediately
preceded it. For example, if the first Correction is a Zigzag, the x-wave will probably be a mo?owave,
Flat or Triangle. If the first Correction is a Flat, the X-wave will probably be a monowave, Zigzag or
Non-Standard formation (probably not a Triangle). Exceptions do occur, but they are relatively rare.

As the time covered by a polywave begins to increase, one of the corrective sections of the
polywave will begin to subdivide ( either wave-2 or
wave-4). Never will one of the odd numbered
segments of an Impulse pattern subdivide before
one of the even numbered segments ( unless the
Impulse pattern is Tenninal).

Failure
\
\
\
\
\
For the following reasons, an Impulse
interpretation is eliminated. Wave-(3) is
the shortest wave of the group (impossible). Even if wave-(3) were longer than
wave-(l ), the break-out of the fourth wave
Triangle is too large. Any Triangular
break-out of more than 200% virtually
guarantees a Non-Limiting Triangle is
forming, not a 4th-wave or b-wave Triangle. The length and time durations of
each advance are too similar for them to be
labeled with the same Impulsive degree.
A Triangle ( or a mono wave) is the most
likely formation to occur in the x-wave position if the last pattern is going to be a Flat
withac-waveFailure. Thenextbestchoice
for the x-wave would be a monowave (as
longastheoverallformationisnottoocomplicated). The Complexity Level of the xwave should be at least the same as the cwave which preceded it and should be no
more complex than the most complex Standard pattern in the entire formation.

Comparing all of the ad vane es to advances and declines to declines, IOO many similarities in price and
time occur for this to be an Impulse pattern. Sometimes this is mistakenly calleda9 or 11-wave move OR
a move without an identifiable extension. This is
~ incorrect Every Elliott pattern has to behave a particular way; if it does not, it is not the pattern
it is assumed to be, PERIOD. Impulse patterns need
clearly visible extensions and alternation must occur
between waves two and four. Without those two rules

2. 3-3-5 Flats (all variations, except Elongated)
3. 3-3-3-3-3 Triangles (Contracting Non-Limiting, only)
4. 3? This series (mostly included to get your attention) represents a Corrective
monowave which can be an X-wave in "simple" Double and Triple patterns. Keep
in mind, x-waves are almost always the smallest Corrective patterns (time-wise) of a
complex formation whether or not they are larger or smaller in price coverage than
the previous Correction.
5. When the X-wave is shorter than the previous corrective phase and is not one of the
above patterns, its Construction is limited to Non-Standard Category 2 patterns (see
Chapter 10, the Power Ranking diagram. [As a reminder, to properly associate
a complex X-wave with the previous Correction, make sure the LOGIC Rules are
followed for proper integration of market action.]
b. Complex Correction With Large X-Wave(s)
When the X-wave of a Complex formation is larger than the previous Correction (price-wise), the.
entire formation will be categorized as a Double or Triple Three pattern. Listed below are the NonStandard wave patterns, along with their names and compacted wave Structures, in which the X-wave
is larger than the previous Corrective phase (in the listing, c.t. = "Contracting Triangle only!").
1. (3-3-5) + (x-wave) + (3-3-3-3-3, c.t.) = Double Three Combination= 3
2. (3-3-5) + (x-wave) + (3-3-5) = Double Three= 3
3. (3-3-5) + (x-wave) + (3-3-5) + (x-wave) + (3-3-3-3-3, c.t.) = Triple Three Com.= 3
4. (3-3-5) + (x-wave) + (3-3-5) + (x-wave) + (3-3-5) = Triple Three= 3

The Non-Standard wave patterns listed above are in order of most to least likely. Triple Threes, as
mentioned earlier, should be considered rare. When you see one of these patterns, it probably will be
constructed like one of the two variations listed on page 8-15.
Review
Once you have decided what Non-Standard wave pattern variation the market has formed, detour
to the Logic Rules chapter and check the list of attributes associated with that particular formation.
Examine the "realistic" diagrams in the Non-Standard section to see if the pattern you are working with
resembles the one in the book. Remember, exact correlations are not only unnecessary. but very
improbable. Afterward, move on to the Conclusion chapter to finalize your assessment.

This pattern is usually misinterpreted. Occasionally, due to the Triangle fonnation, it is
interpreted as an Impulse wave about to begin
wave-5 (see upper right, next page). Sometimes it is labeled as an Impulse wave under
fonnation which is about to complete a series of
1 'sand 2's (see lower right, next page).
Figure8-9

This incorrect interpretation of a
Double Three Running Correction is
very common due to the association
many make of Triangles with 4th
waves. Complicating the situation, a
Triangle in one of these patterns fre.
quently does not "overlap" the first ab-c Correction, thus creating the illusion of an Impulse wave with a first
wave extension. The signal that this
interpretation is incorrect is the Structure of wave-3. In this diagram it is
Corrective, eliminating the possibility
that this interpretation is correct, unless the market is fanning a Terminal
Impulse. The thrust out of the Triangle will answer that question. If the
thrust is bigger than wave-3, the pattern is a Double Three Running Correction; if less, a Tenninal Impulse.

market develop in a parabolic fashion.
Each smaller Degree 2nd wave should take
less time and price, be of a more Powerful
Construction and retrace less (percentagewise) than the previous larger Degree 2nd
wave. In a like manner, _ each smaller

Slightly different from Complex polywaves, a Multiwave requires one of the Impulse segments
subdivides into a polywave. Depending on which Clas.s the pattern you are analyzing falls in, divert to
the Impulsive or Corrective heading below.
Impulsive
In a polywave, all ":5's" are monowaves. In a Multiwave, one (or more) of the ":5's" is a polywave.
To construct a Multiwave, several conditions are required. They are as follows:
1. Of the three thrust waves in an Impulse pattern ( 1, 3, or 5), one- and only one -must be a polywave.
The other two thrust waves should be monowaves.
2. At least one of the Corrective phases (either wave 2 or 4) must be a polywave; the other may be
a mono- or polywave.
3. The Correction (2 or 4) which takes the longest period of time should occur immediately before
or after the Extended wave. If the 1st wave extended, wave-2 should take the most time. If the
5th wave extended, wave-4 should take more time than wave-2. If the 3rd wave extends, it makes
no difference which wave (wave-2 or wave-4) takes more time; simply make sure Alternation is
present between the two waves.
Figure 8-13a displays a very common Multiwave pattern. The 3rd wave is the Extended and
Subdivided wave (see Extensions vs. Subdivisions, page 8-21,for detailed coverage of the Subdivision
concept and the Rules which govern its operation) creating the only Trending polywave of the pattern.
Waves-I and 5 are the two Trending monowaves (see Rule 1 above). Wave-4, the largest corrective
pattern, occurred immediately after the Extended 3rd wave (see Rule 3). The diagrams in Figure 8-13b
also show the same Rules being followed by Multiwaves with 1st and 5th wave Extensions.

CoITective
A Corrective Multiwave has requirements imposed on it similar to the Impulsive variety. They are:
1. One or two of the ":5' s" in the larger pattern must visibly subdivide into a polywave (see Figure
8-14). If there is only one subdivided ":5," it must be wave-c of a Flat or Zigzag (all varieties).
2. The probabilities .s.trow favor the b-wave of a Multiwave will be a Corrective polywave.
Again, as indicated in the Impulsive section, all other Rules listed from the beginning of the book
which refer to Corrections should apply to Multiwaves of all varieties.
FigureS-14
b:3
c:5
In the Figure on the left, the
c-wave(a ":5") subdivides.
That is the minimum requirement for a Multiwave
to be created. The Figure
on the right bas two Subdivided ":S's," but the pattern is still a Multiwave.
Obeying Rule 2 (above),
the b-wave in both patterns
is a polywave.

The discussion on Complex Multiwaves is basically the same as Complex Polywaves. The only
difference is Complex Multiwaves are made from a collection of Multiwaves, not a collection of
Polywaves. If you witness a Corrective Multiwave which is retraced 161.8% or more by the next
correction, OR is retraced less than 61.8% by the next corrective phase, then a Complex pattern is
forming. Apply the same Rules and principles as those discussed in the Complex Polywave section.

As a market continues to unfold, a group of Multiwaves will eventually need to be formed into a
Macrowave. Fortunately, the processes explained in the Multiwave section under the Impulsive and
Corrective headings are the same as those that need to be used to form Macrowaves. The only differences
are those listed below under the Impulsive and Corrective headings.
Impulsive
The minimum construction necessary to form a Macrowave is at least one of the ":5's" (wave-I, 3,
or 5) must be a Multi wave and one of the other ":5's" must be a Polywave. Usually there will be two
polywaves, but on rare occasions, the smallest wave might be a monowave. This creates a condition of
"Triplexity ," a word coined by the author which means "three Levels of Complexity contained within
the same pattern." From observation, it appears the only time Triplexity is possible is when the 5th wave
Extends and Subdivides in an Impulse wave or when wave-c is the most complex pattern of a Flat or
Zigzag. For an illustration of Triplexity in action, refer to the bottom of page 7-10.
Corrective
To form a Macrowave Correction, at least one wave must be a Multi wave and one wave a Polywave.
If only one Multiwave occurs in a Correction, it should be wave-c of a Zigzag or Flat. All other rules
applying to Multi- and Polywaves would also apply for Macrowaves.

Intricacy
In the Central Considerations chapter, the concept of Alternation was presented. The simple
aspects of the Rule (Time, Price, Severity) should be readily understood by now. The more difficult
aspects of Alternation (Intricacy and Construction, first mentioned on page 5-5) will be covered here to
make sure there is no misunderstanding on the subject. Starting with Intricacy, this deals with the
number of subdivisions present in one pattern compared to those of an adjacent pattern. This concept
is difficult to apply to highly developed patterns, but is a very useful and critical test at the polywave and
multi wave level. It is always preferable that one wave subdivides and one does not. Below are examples
of how this happens in Corrective and Impulsive formations (see Figure 8-15).

Unlike a corrective phase, wave-I cannot subdivide without wave-2 subdividing ( unless the
market is fonning a Tenninal pattern).
Waves-3 & 4 can Alternate on an Intricacy
basis in the same way waves-I & 2 did above.
Construction of Complex Polywaves, Multiwaves, etc. 8-19
Construction
If adjacent waves in an Impulsive or Corrective pattern both subdivide, other forms of Alternation
need to be considered to keep the count accurate. One of the forms in which Alternation can occur is
Construction. If one pattern is a Zigzag, expect the next pattern to be anything but a Zigzag (see Figure
8-16a). If the market forms an Impulse pattern, expect the next move, of the same Degree, always to be
a Corrective pattern (see Figure 8-16b below).

Both of theses patterns exhibit Alternation of Construction. In the upper
diagram, the Alternation is between
two different corrective patterns. In the
lower diagram, the Alternation is between an Impulsive pattern and a Corrective pattern. Obviously, the lower

Extensions .u. Subdivisions
Most Elliotticians think of the term Extension as describing two inextricably linked factors; that of
length and the number of subdivisions present in a pattern. Through many years of study, I have
discovered the two factors, Extensions and Subdivisions, to be separate phenomena. The term Extension
should only be thought of as describing the longest trending wave (wave-I, 3 or 5) of an Impulse
sequence. It should not automatically be assumed that the longest wave in a pattern will be the most
subdivided. On rare occasions, the longest wave will be one of the simpler patterns (based on Complexity
ratings) and the subdivided pattern will be the second longest segment. This indicates the Extension Rule
should be applied separately from the Subdivision Rule (see Independent Rule, page 9-7). Granted, the
two rules (Extension & Subdivision) will usually be simultaneously present in the same wave (90% of
the time), but not always. Figure 8-17 shows how a pattern looks when both Rules are affecting the same
wave. Figure 8-18 shows how the two Rules might act inde.pendently of each other. Figure 8-19 shows
how the Rules should not be applied and where they cannot act independently of each other.
Figure 8-17
In this diagram, the I st wave wasthelongest(theextension)
and it subdivided one Level of Complexity more than the
other Impulse advances (waves 3 and 5). Each Extended
segment (on this page and the next) is designated with an

Importance of Knowing which Wave Extended
The Extended wave in an Impulse sequence is the most significant factor in deciding the appearance,
relationships and behavior of an Impulse pattern. Knowing which wave Extended instantly provides you
with a wealth of information on how the pattern will channel and which Correction (2 & 4) will be the
most complex. Let's take a look at the four major Impulse variations depending on which wave Extends,
beginning with a 1st wave extension in Figure 8-20.
FigureS-20
1.00
When the 1st wave is the longest, the pattern will assume an ascending
wedge shape. The upper trendline is usually drawn across the terminal
ends of the !stand 3rd waves. Unlike a Terminal Impulse, where the 5th
wave usually breaks the uppertrendline, this pattern generally completes
its 5th wave below and away from the upper trendline. When the I st wave
is the longest, wave-2 should be more complex than wave-4.
There are three significantly different formational variations possible when the 3rd wave extends.
Below is the first variation, the last
two are on the next page.
The 4th wave (in this case) at its lowest point
should not retrace more than 38.2% of wave3. If it does, wave-5 willprobablynotmakea
new high, thereby creating a 5th wave Failure.
This setup occurs when wave-I is "microscopic" in relation to the Extended 3rd wave. The 5th
wave will usually relate to the whole move (beginning of wave-I to end of the end of wave-3)
by 38.2%. If it is more than 38.2%,(such as 61.8%) the move is just a Zig-Zag and what you
thought was wave-I & 2 are probably part of a previous pattern, orless likely, they were incidentally visible parts of the first advance to point "M" (see "Missing Waves," page 12-34).

When a pattern channels like one of the
two diagrams on this page, and it completes a larger pattern, it is very possible
Wave-5 lllllXJllll exceed the end of
Wave-3. If it does not, the 5th-Wave
would be labeled a 5th Wave Failure.
In this example, Wave-3 should advance at a slower
rate than the previous diagram ( close to that of Wave-
!) so the parallel channel is not broken by Wave-3. In
this situation, you can be relatively certain Wave-5 will
not touch or break the upper trendline.

Most Common Setup
A 5th wave Extension will usually be 161.8% of
the entire move measured from the very beginning of the pattern to the top of wave-3, illustrated by "m" & "n's" External relationship*.
Occasionally, the 5th wave will relate Internally to "m" by adding the equal length ( or
161.8% of the length) to the end of wave-4.
Less likely relationships include the 5th wave
being 100% of"m" Q[ 261.8% of"m."
Wave-4 should be more complex and time
consuming than wave-2 when the 5th wave
extends. One odd thing about wave-4
(when wave-5 extends) is it generally retraces a significant amount ( 40-61.8 % of
wave-3. For wave-4 to counteract a significant retracement, it will usually end in a cwave failure (see diagram above) or complete above its lowest point by way of a
Complex correction concluding with a
Non-limiting Triangle).

Knowing Where to Start a Count
llllllml~IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
As the Complexity of a pattern increases beyond the 1st-Level, Trending waves within Impulse
patterns begin to develop into their own Impulsive polywaves. Due to the difficulties which arise when
trying to decipher moves beyond Level-2 Complexity, knowing when an Impulse sequence is complete
requires strict adherence to numerous rules, channeling techniques, and Fibonacci relationships (all to
be outlined in this book). Proper analysis requires knowing how Impulse patterns begin and end and how
they combine with other patterns. To do this you must first correctly decipher small Impulse patterns.
When first trying to analyze a market's price action, You may be tempted to start with long-term price
charts. In doing this, you could easily misinterpret the position of the market due to a common mistake;
that of starting the count from a major high or low (see Figure 8-21). To start an interpretation from the

An inexperienced analyst would be tempted
to begin the analysis from the circled low
and possibly label the move upward as
indicated in Figure 8-21a. For several reasons this would be incorrect.
1. Both waves-2 & 4 indicate strength.
That conflicts with the Rule of Alternation.
2. Wave-2 retraces more than 61.8% of
Wave-I contradicting the signs of strength
indicated by an Irregular correction.
3. Waves-3 & 5 are too close in price
coverage. This conflicts with the "Rule of
Extension"

down move.

An incorrect analysis of this move could easily make you
. think 2nd waves frequently retrace almost all (i.e. more than
61.8%) of Wave-I. Actually, a 2nd wave retracement of
wave-I exceeding more than 61.8% (even if the tennination
of wave-2 settles at a lesser level) is extremely rare.
How can Figure 8-24b be proven correct over Figure 8-24a?. Wave-2
of 8-24a has retraced too much of Wave-I. This indicates Wave-2 must
subdivide in such a way that thee-wave ofWave-2 does not exceed the
end of wave-a of Wave-7; a large move could not begin until it did.
Based on the length of the dashed line in Figure 8-24a, Wave-2 did not
subdivide.
On the other hand, the action after a 5th wave failure, like that in
Figure 8-24b, would produce a violent reversal of trend due to the
weakness an upside failure implies. Since a severe drop (depicted by
the dashed line) did occur and the Impulse pattern was retraced rapidly,
it is confinned the 5th-Failure scenario is correct (Figure 8-24b).
improper point makes it very difficult to correctly predict what will take place in the future. Believe it
or not, most large Elliott patterns do not finish at the highest or lowest price on a chart. This is an inherent
part of the Wave Theory which is frequently misunderstood and is essentially unique to Elliott. I say it
is unique since most techniques look at the highest high or lowest low as the important price or time
measuring point for further calculations. Often, with Elliott, points below the high or above the low are
more important for specific calculations than the actual high or low. The concept of a pattern finishing
after a high or low is one of the significant reasons many Elliotticians experience difficulty applying
Elliott to longer time periods.
If you start a count from a point on a chart which is not the termination of an Elliott pattern, your
analysis could run astray for long periods of time. Eventually you should be able to recognize the mistake
and make the appropriate adjustments. Unfortunately, by the time a mistake is detected, the market move
could be nearing completion or you may have taken several losses due to trades initiated based on
inaccurate assumptions. All this is, of course, due to starting a count from a "visually" important top or
bottom which is not the termination of an Elliott pattern.
The more Elliott patterns you combine into larger patterns, the more likely the larger pattern will
finish below (above) the highest (lowest) price level obtained (see Figure 8-21b at the bottom of page
8-27). Why does this happen? At the end of a major trend, the market begins to lose momentum. It is
this loss of momentum which sometimes prevents the market from making a new high or low right at
the end of a pattern. Loss of momentum generally manifests itself in one of four forms:
a. An Impulse pattern will contain a 5th-Wave Failure
b. A Flat pattern will finish with a C-Wave Failure
c. A complex or rare formation will end with a Contracting, Non-Limiting Triangle
d. An Impulsion will conclude with a Terminal pattern
(Each incident listed above is diagramed on the previous page (Figure 8-23) using the same
alphabetic lettering.)
Three of the four situations above (a, b & c) always create a situation where the highest or lowest price
on the chart i.ull!t the end of the Elliott pattern. The Terminal pattern, if its 5th wave subdivides, can
also conclude below the highest high or above the lowest low if wave-5 exhibits a loss of momentum
in one of the three circumstances listed above (scenario a,b, or c ) .
If a pattern is completely retraced and the highest price achieved by the market is not the end of the
Elliott pattern, the termination point will occur .i!f1!.!: the high, not before. Always be on the lookout for
a secondary spike or trough following an important high or low. It may be warning that an Elliott pattern
terminated after the top or bottom. Also, watch for a significant amount of consolidation near, but after,
an important high or low. The consolidation may be a Non-Limiting Triangle which terminates the trend
after the high or low.
Starting counts from improper points can often lead to incorrect conclusions about the correct
application of Elliott Rules. Figure 8-24 demonstrates how that may take place. Another incorrect
conclusion most analysts make is in reference to the series of l's and 2's of decreasing degree which
occasionally takes place as the market approaches the center of a 3rd wave Extension, the most frequent
wave to extend (see Figure 8-25, next page).

Count A
This is the starting pof t for the downtrend
V
There are a number of significant Logic and Rule errors involved in count "A"; they are as follows:
1. The length of waves 1, 3 & 5 are .all too close to the same price distance.
2. Waves 2 & 4 do not alternate well.
3. During the decline, wave-2 takes more time and percentage retracement than wave (ii). This
indicates the market is not getting weaker (which is mandatory as you approach the middle
of a declining 3rd wave) but is getting stronger.
4. The 0-(ii) trendline was broken by the 2nd-wave indicating wave-(ii) is run finished
or it is incorrectly interpreted.
Count "B" presents the proper way to label the above move. Notice the market did not begin to
decline quickly until time "ran out" at the apex point of the triangle. This is typical of this type of NonLimiting Triangle.

Mentioned in the beginning of the book, many of the Neely Extensions have simply been integrated
into the text where appropriate. Virtually all of Chapter 3 discussed techniques which I developed over
years of teaching the Telephone Course. The step by step, objective process of analysis - which is the
essence of "Mastering Elliott Wave" - was also created during the teaching of the same course. A
multitude of new, more descriptive words were coined or redefined (Monowaves, Polywaves, Complexity, Compaction etc.) to assist in more accurate communication on the subject. The Progress Label and
Logic Rule sections, the concept of a NEW type of Triangle with its own, unique formational rules and
the significant advances in the quantification of Triangular activity are all important additions to the
Elliott Wave Theory and are what comprise the Neely Method. Furthermore, all the rules in Chapter
9 also belong in the above list.
While the Rules which follow are not quite as important as the ones discussed up to this point, they
are..Y!ID'. helpful in increasing your pattern interpretation confidence level. Quite often, the utilization
of these more subtle Rules will help you decide which of a list of possibilities is the most probable.
Trendline Touchpoints
This rule will help you quickly differentiate between Impulsive and Complex Corrective activity.
The Rule states that, "in a pattern consisting of five segments (which has six possible 'same degree'
touch points), only a total of four can simultaneously touch the two opposing trendlines (see Figure
9-1). This rule is applicable to Impulsive (Trending and Terminal) and Triangular patterns since both
are composed of five segments. NOTE: This Rule was partially covered under the Triangle heading
(Central Considerations, page 5-25).
Basic Neely Extensions 9-1
Figure 9-1
Ssome leeway to the Touch Points Rule
may occasionally be required during the
fonnation of non-limiting Triangles.
The dots are the four points
which touch opposing
trendlines, the x's do noL
In this diagram, of the six points
which make-up an Impulse wave,
onlyalQlaloffour (thedots)touch
the upper and lower trendlines.
The x' s indicate the two points
which do not touch a trendline.
Again, only four (a different four)
points of the same degree touch the
parallel trendlines (marlced with
dots). The two that do not touch
either one of the trendlines are
marked with an "x".
How can this Rule be used to best advantage? Over long periods of time, when a pattern is developing
on a Complex Poly-, Multi- or Macrowave level, the existence of mm than four touchpoints on the
parallel trendlines is a strong indication of Corrective, not Impulsive, activity. Usually, the Corrective
pattern would be a Double or Triple Zigzag or Combination. Even though it is not typical, more than
four touch points could occur along the two trendlines (which may be converging, diverging, or parallel)
in an Impulse pattern , but not all of those touch points_wiH be of the same Degree. Remember, the Rule
only applies to waves of the same degree.
The rule also applies to other Standard corrective patterns. All Standard Corrections have four
possible touch points. Only three of the four points should touch parallel trendlines. If four points of
the "same degree" touch parallel trendlines in any Standard correction ( except Triangles), it is a reliable
indication the Correction will be part of a Complex, Non-Standard formation. This rule is most useful
during Zigzags (see Figure 9-2).
9-2 Basic Neely Extensions
Figure9-2
All four tennination points touch the parallel trendlines. If the last ~ is
the end of the Zig1.ag, it indicates the
Zigzag will only be ll.illl of a much larger
Double or Triple Zig1.ag OR Double or
Triple Combination. See below.
Expect an x-wave to fonn immediately after
a situation such as that discussed above. What
type of Complex Zigzag pattern is going to talce
place depends on a lot of variables. Read the
Advanced Progress Label Application and the
Advanced Logic Rules chapters for clues on
what to expect.
If the Zigzag is not over at the fourth touch
point, expect that touch point to be the end of a 1st
wave extension within the c-wave of the Zig1.ag
(see below).
Basically, the Touch Point rule states that
"a perfectly channelable Zig1.ag should not
be the end of a Corrective phase."
Basic Neely Extensions 9-3
Time Rule
Time plays an important function in producing the correct look for a wave pattern. Elliott discovered
that the two unextended waves in an Impulse pattern often conform to the same time duration. Also, he
noticed that waves a & c in a Zigzag tended toward equality in time. After years of observation, I have
discovered there are many additional ways time can be used to enhance the analytical process.
In its simplest form, the Time Rule can be stated as such: No three adjacent waves (of the same
Degree) can be simultaneously equivalent in time (see Figure 9-3).
Figure 9-3
Any three adjacent patterns in a
sequence will usually relate in one
ll{ more of the following ways
~ Verydifferent ------I Waves I & 3 are
similar in time
but Wave 2 is
very different
Waves 2 & 3 are similar in time but, Wave-I is very different.
This situation would only occur if wave-I were the extension
Observation: Any three adjacent patterns in a sequence will usually relate by time in one of the
following ways:
A. If the first two segments of a pattern are equal in time, the third will consume much less or much
more time than either one of the other two taken separately. Often, the third segment will
consume the accumulated time of the two smaller patterns.
B. If the second segment is much longer in time than the first, the third segment will equal the first
or relate to it by 61.8% or 161.8%.
C. If none of the waves are of the same time duration, they may all relate by a Fibonacci ratio.
See Figure 9-4 for an example of how the above Rules might effect the development of a Flat.

Frequently, if no two waves are equal in time, all waves will
relate by 61.8% or 38.2%.
Application of the Time Rule
If two adjacent patterns take equal amounts of time followed by a third segment which also takes the
same amount of time, you can confidently assume ( on any scale above simple polywave development)
that the third segment is not complete or that the three segments being viewed are not all of the same
Degree (see Figure 9-5, next page).

All these moves take the same

Good P~ibility
This interpretation eliminates the problem of three same degree waves occurring

the same amount of time. The third segment (wave-I) is a lower degree pattern,
so now only two adjacent waves are equal
in time, which is how it should be.

Independent Rule
The Independent Rule applies to all other Rules of the Theory that already have been and will be
presented in this book. All Elliott Rules and guidelines (and the Neely Extensions) should be applied
as separate entities to every wave pattern deciphered ( as long as there is enough detailed price action to
apply them). In other words, do not get in the habit of thinking certain characteristics always go handin-hand. Example: Most Elliotticians believe Extensions and Subdivisions are synonymous. Usually,
the two concepts are present in the same pattern at the same time, but not always. Each Rule, that of
Extensions and Subdivisions, should be considered independently. If they are simultaneously present
in the same move, fine. If they are not, the validity of the proposed count is not in jeopardy.
Simultaneous Occurrence
This Rule was needed to solidify all the other rules presented in this book. To define Simultaneous
Occurrence, all Elliott rules applicable to a particular situation have to be "simultaneously" present in
order to create a reliable interpretation. To apply this rule, begin with the rules and techniques described
in Preliminary Analysis, continue to through the Intermediary Observations, Central Considerations, etc. If any Rule normally associated with the pattern on your chart does not manifest, it is likely
some other formation is developing. The count which meets all or most of the applicable parameters
should be considered the best interpretation. Do not forget, even post-pattern behavior is part of the
investigative process needed to find the foremost choice.
Exception Rule
ASPECT 1
Occasionally, at important market turning points or under "unusual" conditions, one of the Rules
which is usually critical to proper pattern construction may not apply or be followed. An important Rule
would be any found from Chapter 3 up to (but not including) the "Breaking Point" section under
Impulsions or Corrections in Chapter 5. Situations which substantiate "unusual" conditions are:
A. The end of a Multiwave or larger pattern.
B. The 5th wave or C-wave of a Terminal (diagonal triangle) pattern.
C. A move which i£ or~ with a Contracting or Expanding Triangle.
Not mentioned until now, Triangles and Terminal patterns are the exception to virtually all Rules,
situations and conditions (i.e. time, price, channeling, Progress Labels, Fibonacci relationships, etc.).
Whenever an important Rule gets broken, it is likely that a Triangle or a Terminal pattern had something
to do with it.
If a major Rule is not represented in the market action being observed, the interpretation might still
be acceptable as long as there is substantiation for the failure of the Rule. Substantiation might come from
one of the conditions above (A, B, or C). The extreme importance of the Rules discussed up to the
"Breaking Point" headings in Chapter 5 precludes the possibility that two important Rules be broken simultaneously. If more than one important Rule is "broken" the count should be eliminated.
Basic Neely Extensions 9-7
ASPECT2
Another aspect of the Exception Rule states:
"The failure of a Rule occurs for a specific reason; this reason usually creates another Rule."
Below are two examples of how this happens:
1. The 2-4 trend.line of an Impulse wave should~ be broken by any part of wave-3 and
hardly ever by any part of wave-5. If the 2-4 trendline is broken by part of wave-5, this activates
a Rule which says "the market must be forming a Terminal Impulse pattern." A Terminal
pattern is a legitimate reason for the break of a true 2-4 trendline.
2. When the "thrust" out of a Triangle does not stop advancing or declining when the time zone
occupied by the apex point of the Triangle is reached, then the market is forming a Terminal
pattern or the previous Triangle was of the Non-Limiting type.
Necessity of Maintaining "Structure" Integrity
. Struct~re is the c~tical consideration in putting together a "Progress Label" scenario. Only through
stnct attennon to detail, and adherence to past wave Structure, can you expect to accurately interpret a
market with any consistency. With larger patterns, analysis can become more difficult, unless proper
~3:~ has been taken to dissect each subsegment and classify it as Corrective or Impulsive ( :3 or :5). Even
~f 1t 1s currently not clear which pattern a market is forming, adherence to past, provable price "structure"
1s ~andatol")'.. Eventually, the Elliott pattern which has been under formation all along will become
obvious. This usually occurs as the pattern approaches a conclusion.
Locking in Structure
After having identified a reliable Elliott pattern, and then proceeding through the process of
Compaction, it is very important the simplified Structure of the move (being just a :3 or :5) is not changed
at some later date. This would be a drastic mistake. Generally, you should never change the Structure
of a properly Compacted pattern. Often, you might be tempted to do so in order to create an interpretation
you would like to believe is unfolding, but as a Rule, never do it.
Contrary to what appears a common belief among Elliotticians and especially the general public, the
Structure of a formation cannot be legitimately changed at the whim of the analyst to suit current opinion,
market fundamentals, technical indicators, etc. Wave patterns develop based on the net result of all the
buy and sell orders reaching the floor of an exchange. Those buy and sell orders are sent to the floor by
traders around the country who are analyzing Fundamentals, Technicals, Astrological aspects, Volume,
Open Interest, Bullish Sentiment, etc. Since a market cannot move unless there is someone bidding to
buy or someone asking to sell (all other events notwithstanding), when the two come together it creates
an "official" supply/demand price level. As a result, there is no disputing that price action is the net result
of all external market influences.and therefore is the best indicator of future-market performance.
The level at which a market trades does not occur by chance. The trade takes place because it satisfies
both sides of the equation, the buyer and the seller. Waves are the by-product of these transactions
connected end-to-end showing a continuous chain of events. Transforming the structure of a pattern to
fit what you feel is going on or because you are confused about the market's position is aYm.J2QQrreason
to alter the previously established "Structure" of a count. Changing previous wave "structure" to make
the count finish the way you "believe" it should or to getthe pattern to complete sooner will almost always
9-8 Basic Neely Extensions
result in an incorrect interpretation.
Under the Wave Principle, extreme confidence in a change of price direction is only possible as the
market terminates the last wave segment. The only way to stay on track between one important
termination point and the next is to do the following:
a. Mark the termination point of every single monowave on your chart with a dot
(this step can be eliminated as you become more experienced).
b. Study the Retracement Rules and then using the Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic, carefully
place the appropriate Structure Label(s) at each turning point.
c. Look for group Structure combinations among adjacent monowaves which adhere to
acceptable (Standard or Non-Standard) Elliott Series'.
d. Once a Series is identified, move to the appropriate section
(Impulsions or Corrections) of Chapter 5.
e. Proceed through all the Essential Rules which apply to that general formation category.
f. Place Progress Labels on the wave pattern and continue through the "Conditional
Rules" section.
g. Check all the applicable Rules and guidelines (under Advanced Progress Label Application &
the Advanced Rules of Logic) to confirm all minor details and subtleties of wave behavior
are present (Alternation, Fibonacci relationships, etc.). If it passes those tests, go to the next step.
h. Compact the pattern to its base structure, ":3" or ":5" (see Compaction, Chapter 7).
i. If you are working strictly with monowaves, raise the Complexity Level of the Compacted
pattern to Level-I (underline the :5 or :3). If you have developed beyond the monowave stage,
raise the Complexity of the Structure Label to the appropriate level based on the techniques
discussed in the "Complexity" section of Chapter 7.
j. After Compaction and Complexity designation, the process begins over again. Return
to step-b to confirm if the newly compacted pattern effects or changes any potential
Structure Labels for the monowaves (or higher) surrounding the compacted pattern.*
Then move on to step-c, etc. Continue returning to step-b until you have numerous
compacted patterns each marked with a~ Structure Label. These single Structure
Labels will eventually form identical Series just as the monowave groups once did. The
only difference, each Structure Series will be representing a polywave (or higher) instead
of a monowave. All the Rules discussed up until now, and throughout the book, will work
for these more complex patterns in the same fashion as they did for the simple formations
(except where noted). Work with the compacted Series' just as if they were monowave
Structure Labels. Look for Series combinations, apply the "Rule of Similarity ... ", etc. The
only additional step necessary in working with the more complex patterns is to check for and
follow the Rules under the "Construction of Complex Polywaves, Multiwaves etc."
The compacted Str,11pture Labels should be placedgn your charts which cover a period oftime longer
than the original monowave chart. On your longer-term chart, only mark the sini:le Structure of each
compacted polywave, do not bother with each individual monowave's Structure.
The Wave Theory is a relative phenomenon. It does not matter how complex or simple a pattern is;
what matters is whether the pattern is Corrective or Impulsive in nature. That will tell you how to handle,
combine, interpret and trade market action.
*This is describing the process of Reassessment which is covered in greater detail at the top of page 7-3 in Chapter 7.
Basic Neely Extensions 9-9
Until the market reaches the end of a Series, guessing on the proper Progress Labels which apply is
just that, a guess. You do not have to know the Progress Labels of a wave pattern to trade it profitably!
Trade with the trend which, based on the Wave Theory, is in the direction of the ":'S's" (Impulsions).
Until you have at least three or five Structure Labels to work with, it is impossible to complete an Elliott
pattern and thus impossible to be completely certain of the name of the pattern actually unfolding.
In conclusion, you should not have any preconceived notions of a markets' future behavior. The only
objective way to analyze a market is to stay strictly with previously determined wave Structure and only
combine the patterns when an identifiable Series is complete and when the pattern meets all important
criteria. Do not waste time trying to continually guess, and trade on, what you think is the current position
of the market.
Flexibility of"Progress" Labels (expansion of a pattern)
It should now be evident why the earlier sections of the book dealt with Structure, instead of Progress
labels. It may not be clear, though, why Structure should filill be the main focus of your attention.
As mentioned in the last section, Progress Labels are the final touch on a wave pattern, not the first
step. What was not mentioned; "after Progress labels have served their purpose in solidifying a pattern,
they are no longer helpful in clarifying the larger picture."
Once a pattern is complete, Compaction (see Chapter 7) is necessary to reduce the larger formation
to its base Structure. This base Structure is needed to integrate the pattern with other Compacted
segments into a larger formation. Knowing the Progress labels of each individual section of the
previously Compacted pattern has no further value. You must use the base Structure of the compacted
pattern on a longer-term chart to decide how the Compacted segment becomes part of a larger Series.

One of the last, critical considerations of an interpretation's validity involves the incorporation of
Logic into the market action. This is an area of the Wave Theory which is completely overlooked by the
majority. The Logic rules are the product of exhaustive market research and observation by the author,
from an Elliott Wave standpoint, for over a half-decade. The essence of the I &gjc Ruh:s• Post-pattern
market action must adhere to specific types of behavior which is predicated upon the pattern just
completed.
For example: after completing a Terminal Impulse pattern, the reaction should be quite violent and
should retrace all of the Terminal pattern within less than 50% of the time consumed by the Terminal
Impulse. Lack of obedience to this Rule indicates a significant flaw with the current interpretation. If
you thought you had uncovered a Terminal pattern in a market, but post-Terminal behavior did not react
as described, a Terminal Impulse pattern never existed in the configuration predicted.
From a slightly broader perspective, the Logic Rules pertain to the integration of separate Elliott
patterns in a reasonable, coherent, and consistent manner. The majority of rules which make up the "logic
complex" revolve around the inherent strength and weakness implications of each Corrective pattern and
it's variations. The table below covers many situations in which pattern implications are crucial to the
correct interpretation of a move.
Pattern Implications
All Elliott patterns imply and transfer specific amounts of "Power" to future market action. In
addition, many require particular post-pattern behavior including the minimum price length the next
pattern should achieve and the minimum time it should consume.
The table below lists each Corrective pattern, along with its Power rating. Power ratings indicate
whether strength or weakness is inferred by the pattern in question. Using a numerical scale from -3 to
+3, the lowest rating belongs to market action which is very detrimental to upside price potential. The
Advanced Logic Rules 10-1
+3 ranking is for patterns which are very beneficial to the continuation of a market advance. To decide
on the subtle "Power" differences between two corrections given the same rating, here is what you do.
When the rating is positive, the Correction listed farthest away from neutral is the stronger of the two.
If the rating is negative, the pattern farthest away from neutral will be the weaker correction.
Retracement Based on Power Ratings
Having an idea of the "power" of a correction is extremely important in the Logical integration
process. It provides you with an accurate idea of whether a Correction will, should, might, should not
or will not get completely retraced by the next move. Some corrections are so weak (or strong) they
cannot terminate a move. Any formation which concludes upward and has a+ 1 to+ 3 rating should not
be fully retraced by the next pattern (of the same Degree). Caveat: It has been the author's experience
that the legs of Triangles and Terminals do not transfer implications to the next leg (there is always one
~xception to every formational Rule). This indicates if a Double Zigzag is an entire segment of a Triangle
or Terminal it ,:njghJ,be retraced completely by the next leg "of the same Degree." In addition, the next
move may be simpler than the Double Zigzag. As a result of this phenomenon, an important Rule can
be derived. If apatternwitha(+l, +2, +J)or(-1, -2, -3)powerrating iscompletelyretracedbyapattern
with a Power Rating closer to zero butwhichis still of the same Degree, the market is signaling a Triangle
or Terminal pattern if forming (all variations; Expanding or Contracting, 1st, 3rd or 5th Extended).

Realize, a pattern's Power rating can only be properly applied if you fully compact all patterns under
formation. By compacting a move, you arrive at the largest, allowable formation possible. It is the
compacted formation which the Power ratings will reliably affect. For example, let us assume a Double
Zigzag recently completed. If the Double Zigzag occurs anywhere from the first to the second to last
formation of a larger pattern, the Power rating should be reliable. At any one of those points, the
Compaction process would only reveal a completed Double Zigzag as a separate pattern. But, if the
Double Zigzag occurred as the last part of a more Complex formation (such as a Terminal Impulse), the
Powerrating of the Double Zigzag would not be reliable since the largest pattern completed is a Tenninal
Impulse, not a Double Zigzag. In other words, when a pattern is the last part of a larger formation, the
smaller pattern is unimportant. Only take into account the Power rating of the largest pattern.
The higher the absolute value of the Power Rating, the less likely the move will be completely retraced.
Below are the anticipated retracement ratios implied by each possible Power rating:
1. A(" 0") rating does notimply any specific retracement value, virtually any retracement level
is possible from just above 0% to beyond 100% of the previous pattern.
2. A ( + 1,-1) rating would allow for no more than about 90% retracement by the next completed
pattern of the same Degree.
3. A (+2,-2) would indicate no more than about 80% retracement.
4. A (+3,-3) rated pattern should be retraced the least, around 60-70%.
Listed below are all Elliott Corrective patterns (except Triangles, which will be covered shortly).
When the last segment of one of the Corrections listed on the previous page terminates upward on a chart,
the pattern designated #19 would be considered the weakest, while pattern #1 would be the strongest.
If the last segment of one of the Corrections terminated downward, the reverse is true.
Under the next heading, "special situation" notes are listed for each Elliott pattern. These guidelines

lllllllllmllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I II I I I I I I I I I
. The largest price moves in a market happen after Corrective action. This makes understanding the
implications of a Correction far more important than those of an Impulse pattern.
Triple Zigzag
This is the most powerful corrective pattern that can occur. If its movement is downward, it implies
the market is currently very weak. If its movement is upward, the market is currently strong. A Triple
Zigzag will hardly ever be seen but, when it does occur, it is usually the longest segment of a Terminal
or Triangle. When part of a Terminal pattern, it should definitely be the Extended segment. Based on
market position, if a Tenninal is not possible, the only choice is that the Triple Zigzag is the largest
segment of a Triangle. If part of a Flat or Contracting Triangle, a Triple Zigzag can never be completely
retraced by the pattern which immediately follows it of the same Degree .
Advanced Logic Rules 10-3
Triple Combination
This pattern can be a combination of Zigzags, Flats (frequently elongated) and Triangles. Virtually
always, a pattern which falls into this category tenninates with a Triangle. Eitherone of the two x-waves
can also be Triangles, but are not required to be. The first two Corrections ( the one which starts the move
and the one right after the first x-wave) should not be Triangles. When a Triple Combination occurs in
a Triangle, it will be the largest wave of the Triangle in price and probably time also. It can occur in only
one other pattern, a Tenninal Impulse. When a Triple Combination occurs as the extended 5th wave of
a Tenninal, it is the only time the market should completely retrace a Triple Combination, even though
the retracement will be of a larger Degree.
Triple Flat
The pattern which follows a Triple Flat should not completely retrace it~ the Triple Flat is the
last leg of a 5th Extension Terminal (i.e. wave-5). Even then, the retracement pattern would be of one
larger Degree. They should not be completely retraced by the next move of the same Degree. These
patterns are~ and it is unlikely you will ever see one. It is only included here for thoroughness.
Double Zigzag
This pattern should not be completely retraced by the move to follow unless, once again, it is the last
segment of a 5th Extension Tenninal.
Double Combination
Just like a Triple Combination, a Double Combination will almost always end with a Triangle, OR
during simpler (level-I Complexity pattern) patterns, a c-wave failure. This pattern can be completely
retraced if it completes a larger formation (such as a Tenninal Impulse -1st, 3rd or 5th wave Extended),
but usually will not be. If the Corrective phase, after wave-x, finishes with a "severe" C-Failure or a
Running Triangle, then it is possible the entire correction will be completely retraced.
Double Flat
These are not very common patterns, but they do occur. The pattern to follow will probably not
completely retrace the Double Flat unless the Double Flat finishes with a "severe" C-wave Failure or
concludes a larger formation (such as a Tenninal Impulse, any variety). The move following one of these
patterns should be a little faster than the move following a Double Zigzag.
Elongated Zigzag
Named by the author, an Elongated Zigzag pattern occurs almost exclusively in Triangles and
Tenninal Impulse patterns. It will usually be the entire leg of such a pattern. It could occur as any wave
in a Contracting Triangle (except wave-e) or any wave in an Expanding Triangle (except wave-a). It
should never be completely retraced by the wave af the same degree that immediately follows it.
10-4 Advanced Logic Rules
Elongated Flat
This is one of the most interesting and distorted Elliott patterns. The fact that this pattern occurs
almost exclusively in Triangles is a discovery of the author's. It occasionally can be found in Tenninal
Impulse patterns. When in Triangles, it is almost always an entire le& of the Triangle. If not the entire
leg, then it will occur as a "one lower degree" segment of a complex correction which IB the entire leg
of a Triangle.
Zigzag
This ranks among the top three, most common patterns. To be considered simply a Zigzag, the cwave should not be less than 61.8% of wave-a nor more than 161.8%.
Wave-c longest:
Of the three Zigzags listed here, this has the weakest implications if it is moving down and the
strongest if itis moving up. It is not likely to be completely retraced unless the next wave (of the same
degree) is more complex and time-consuming or the Zigzag completes a Corrective phase.
Wave-c equal:
This pattern may or may not be completely retraced. It is one of the most frequently occurring
corrective patterns. Virtually anything could happen after this pattern.
Wave-c shorter:
This pattern is almost sure to be completely retraced unless it is followed by an x-wave. It does not
really give any clues of what to expect from the next pattern.
B-Failure
A B-Failure is the most neutral pattern existing under the Wave Theory. Nothing in particular can
be expected following this pattern since virtually anything is possible.
Common
Again, this is a pretty neutral pattern. It can occur virtually anywhere a Correction is allowed. It does
not imply anything about future market action, but is definitely more powerful than a Zigzag.
Irregular
Despite what many readers may believe, this pattern is actually quite abnormal and infrequent. It
creates a state of"self contradiction." Why? When the b-wave of a pattern exceeds the beginning of
wave-a, it demonstrates the power of the trend of one higher degree. When the c-wave turns around and
exceeds the end of wave-b, it nullifies the power exhibited by the b-wave creating an illogical condition.
This behavior is acceptable in Terminals and Triangles, not in Flats (which is what an Irregular is).
Advanced Logic Rules 10-5
C-Failure
This pattern must be completely retraced by the move to follow of the same degree. If the C-Failure
completes the Corrective phase, the Impulse wave to follow should be larger than the previous Impulse
wave which is traveling in the same direction and is of the same degree. If the C-Failure is not the end
of the larger Correction, the rally to follow should be the x-wave of a Double Three Running Correction,
or less likely, the b-wave of a Running Correction.
l"egular Failure
This pattern must be completely retraced. From this point onward, the patterns listed begin to
indicate "Power" in the opposite direction that they conclude. Usually this pattern will occur as wave2 (of a Trending pattern) which will be followed by an Extended 3rd wave. The Impulse wave after an
Irregular Failure should be bigger than the previous Impulse wave usually by a factor of 1.618.
Double Three
As a general rule, the longer this Correction takes, the more powerful the move to follow should be.
Double Threes are more common as b-waves than 2nd waves. WHY? If a second wave is a Complex
(Non-Standard) Correction, the 3rd wave is most likely going to be the Extended wave. The inherent
Power of that Extension will affect the formation of wave-2. Generally, this power "stretches" the
Double Three in the direction of the 3rd-wave extension to follow, making it a Double Three Running
Correction, not just a Double Three.
The price action for a c-wave would not normally be as large as a 3rd wave Extension. The c-wave's
inherent lack of power usually avoids the stretching effect of the Double Three and therefore prevents
the Double Three from turning into a Running pattern.
Double Three Running Corrections imply a great deal of strength for the trend of one larger degree;
therefore, you are only likely to see one in the 4th wave position if it is followed by a 5th wave extension.
The Impulse move after a Double Three should be at least 161.8% of the previous Impulse wave (i.e.,
if an Impulse wave occurred immediately before the Double Three).
Triple Three
Triple Threes' are a virtually non-existent phenomenon. If you witness one, the Impulse move to
follow should be at least 261.8% of the previous Impulse wave (if there was one). Almost without
exception, Double and Triple Threes drift slightly in the opposite direction of their last wave.
RunningC o"ection
The movement to follow a Running Correction must be the extended wave of an Impulse pattern or
an Elongated c-wave of a Flat or Zigzag. After a Running Correction is complete, the market should
commence with the next Impulse wave; it should not continue to form a more complicated Double or
Triple Three. The Impulse wave after a Running Correction should be more than 161.8% of the previous
Impulse wave; frequently it is 261.8% or more .
10-6 Advanced Logic Rules
Double Three RunningCo"ection
This is a pattern which seems to cause more confusion and controversy than any other. The funniest
part of this story is that a Double Three Running is virtually never interpreted correctly. During their
formation, some Elliotticians count this pattern as a series of 1 's and 2' s. Some will interpret it as a
Terminal Impulse pattern. Some will call it a complex Correction such as a Double Zigzag. The most
important aspect of correctly deciding between all of these unrelated formations is wave Structure (:3
or :5). Strict adherence to Structure is an area many analysts tend to overlook. They casually puttogether
an interpretation based on general shape and appearances, not on concrete structural evidence. To foil
this less diligent group, there are patterns which can Emulate the appearance of other patterns causing
drastic errors in judgment Fortunately, close attention to detail will usually reveal the correct interpretation. Channeling is another key to avoiding the misinterpretation of this pattern (see page 12-2).
The move after a Double Three Running correction must be Impulsive. This Impulsion should
exceed 161.8% of the previous Impulse wave. More than 261.8% is common. Basically, the only place
this pattern will occur is as wave-2; furthermore, the formation almost always concludes with a Triangle.
Triple Three Running Correction
This formation is incredibly rare and for good reason. The power built up by a Double Three Running
Correction is so great it is unrealistic to expect the market to continue to postpone the day of reckoning.
Remember, a market never develops beyond the Triple Three Corrective phase; as a result, the market
cannot "continue creating x-waves indefinitely," as one of my clients once asked. If you were to see a
Triple Three Running Correction, expect the Impulse move following to be a minimum length of261.8%
of the previous Impulse wave.
Triangles
011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 1
The unusual nature of Triangles necessitates they fall into a category all their own. [Non-Limiting
Triangles are a category developed by the author.]
Contracting
A "thrust" (powerful, violent price movement) always follows a Contracting Triangle which, depending on the variation, may be large or small, long or short-lived. The thrust out of a Contracting
Triangle should always exceed the highest or lowest price obtained during the formation of the Triangle
unless it drifts against the direction of wa~e-b. Depending on subtle formational differences, the
Contracting Triangle may be a 4th orb-wave (see Limiting) or an x-wave or the last phase of a Complex
Correction (see Non-Limiting, page 10-8).
Triangles create ( or identify), important support or resistance zones in the market. Once a Triangle
has finished, the price level at which the apex point of the Triangle occurred will provide significant
resistance to any advance m: support to any decline. When the market breaks through one of these
"barriers" it will generally be violent. The important support orresistance created ( or recognized) by the
Triangle is almost always a reliable point to look for Fibonacci relationships, especially if the Triangle
is the b-wave of a Zigzag.
Advanced Logic Rules 10-7
The influence of the Triangle's apex point (horizontallv. price-wise), will usually hold for only two
or three violations. If the market has moved up or down through the price level occupied by the apex
point more than three times, the market is indicating that price level has lost its significance.
I. Limiting
Unlike most Corrections, whose Implications depend a great deal on what the previous Impulse or
Corrective pattern did, Limiting Triangles are "self-descriptive." Post-triangular action in a Limiting
Triangle is dictated by the width of the widest leg of the Triangle and the placement of the apex point
created by the converging trendlines which form the Triangle.* These two factors provide a reliable
price/time window which readily verify ( or nullify) a Limiting Triangle's validity. If the Triangle being
analyzed is truly Limiting, the market action after the thrust should return to the breakout point and will
usually exceed it.
Depending on the slope of the trendlines which encase the Triangle, the thrust could be as much as
;t6 l.8% of the widest leg of the Triangle (added to the end of wave-e) or as little as 7 5%. The thrust should
terminate almost exactly into the time period (not price level) where the converging trendlines crossed,
creating the apex point. If all indications are that the Triangle is ab-wave or a 4th wave, but the postthrust action has not returned to the breakout point or beyond and the market action has exceeded the
original thrust's highest or lowest price level, there must be a Terminal pattern forming (applies to both
situations) or an x-wave unfolding (only applies if the Triangle is ab-wave).
If working with a Limiting B-wave Triangle and the "post-thrust" action does not exceed the
breakout point shortly after the apex time zone is reached, an x-wave is probably forming after the thrust.
a. Horizontal
The thrust out of the Triangle should be approximately equal to the widest wave of the Triangle, plus
or minus 25%. This Triangle variation implies normal market conditions.
b. Irregular
Since the b-wave in one of these patterns exceeds the end of wave-a, it implies the pattern is more
powerfulthan a HorizontaL(ineither price direction). The thrust out of this variation can be as much as
161.8% of the widest leg of the Triangle.
c.Running
This is the most powerful Triangular pattern. The thrust can be as much as 261.8% of the widest leg.
Market conditions are unusually strong (probably climactic) if the Triangle is drifting upward or weak
if the Triangle is drifting downward.
II. Non-Limiting
A Non-Limiting Triangle imposes no specific post-triangular price or time limitations on market
action. The only way to decide what the pattern "implies" is to study the pre-Corrective action. If a
Correction completes with a Triangle it means the Correction must be complex in construction (any
10-8 Advanced Logic Rules
Double or Triple pattern). The Impulse segment of the same Degree after such a pattern (if one occurs),
should be at least the same length as the previous Impulse wave.
The "thrust" out of a Non-Limiting Triangle can, and usually will, be much larger than the width of
the Triangle. Despite this fact, during the early stages of the thrust, the market will usually try to emulate
"normal" post-triangular behavior by initially breaking out approximately the width of the Triangle and
then reacting. Where the two variations differ is in what happens next. As mentioned in the Limiting
section, the apex point of the Triangle (price-wise) should be touched or broken after the thrust. In a NonLimiting Triangle, the reaction will not return to the apex point (price-wise) and will eventually exceed
the end of the initial thrust. Another major difference between Limiting and Non-Limiting patterns is
the Non-Limiting "thrust" .m.11..wll terminate during the time period occupied by the apex point.
Expanding Triangles
The interesting characteristic of Expanding patterns is that they basically imply the opposite
attributes of a Contracting formation. The "thrust" (actually a misnomer), should be lefil! than the widest
leg of the Triangle. If the pattern takes place in the b-wave position, a C-wave Failure is inevitable. Even
if an Expanding Triangle completes a larger pattern, it is unlikely the next move will completely retrace
the e-wave of the Triangle. If it does, the retreacement should take more time than the e-wave.
I. Limiting
There is very little difference between the varieties of Expanding Triangles. The Limiting and Non--·~-
Limiting categories were keptto identify between the 4th-wave/b-wave variety and all other variations.
The only implication that is reliable about this pattern is it should not be completely retraced.
II. Non-Limiting
This variation would define those Expanding Triangles that occur as x-waves, OR the first or last
phase of a complex Corrective pattern. Its most common position is the first phase of a Complex
Correction. In that position it will not be completely retraced by the next move of the same Degree .. If
it is the last phase of a Complex Correction (which is not likely, then it has to be completely retraced.
Impulsions

The implied future behavior of a market is not quite as useful when working with Impulsions. About
the only predictable action after an Impulse pattern regards how much the next move, of the same Degree,
should retrace the Impulsion. It would be very difficult to predict what type of Correction is going to
take place after an Impulsion. The listing to follow covers post Impulsive behavior almost strictly from
the vantage of retracement expectations.
• A concept first presented in the bookEllio11 Wave Principle, Key to Stock Market Profits, by Frost &Prechter:

Advanced Logic Rules 10-9
Trendine
After a Trending Impulse wave concludes, it should never be completely retraced unless it is wave5 or wave-c of a larger pattern. If the Trending Impulse is wave-a, wave-1 or wave-3 of a larger pattern,
the action to follow should not retrace more than 61.8% of the Impulse wave.
Ifretracement of the previous Impulse pattern exct:eds 61.8% and the previous Impulse pattern is
wave-1 of the next larger Degree, expect a complex (relative to wave-1) time consuming 2nd-wave
correction to develop which contains a c-wave Failure. If the Impulse pattern finalized was wave-3 of
the next larger pattern and wave-3 was retraced close to or slightly more than 61.8% by wave-4, expect
a 5th wave Failure to occur. If the 4th-wave recovers from the severe retracement of wave-3 and it
concludes at a 61.8% retracement of wave-3 (or less), a 5th wave Extension is a possibility ifwave-4 is
more complex and time consuming than wave-2 and wave-3 is not more than 261.8% of wave-1.
1st Wave Extension
In an Impulse pattern with a 1st Wave Extension, the action to follow should definitely retrace to the
termination of wave-4 (within the recently completed Impulsion). If the Impulsion completed wave-
( 1) or wave-(5) of a larger Impulse wave, the market should fall into ( or beyond) the price zone for wave2 of the previous Impulsion.
3rd Wave Extension
If the 3rd wave extends within an Impulse wave, the reaction should at least return to the 4th wave
zone ( anywhere from the highest to lowest price of that wne) of the recent Impulse wave. If the entire
Impulse pattern (with the 3rd wave Extension) completes wave-(5) ofalargerpattern, the whole Impulse
wave should be retraced more than 61.8%. If the entire Impulse completes wave-(1) or wave-(3) of a
larger Impulse, the pattern (with the 3rd wave Extension) should be retraced less than 61.8%.
5th Wave Extension
The 5th Wave Extension is the only extended wave which slwuld be consistently retraced more than
61.8% by the next wave of the same Degree nomatterwhatpartof a larger scale the 5th wave is. A 5th
wave Extension should not be completely retraced by the next move of the same Degree unless the 5th
wave concluded wave-c of a Correction. A 5th Extension is one of the few patterns which is not likely
to be completely retraced by even the next move of one bigML Degree.
Tenninal
The market action after a Terminal Impulse must retrace the entire pattern in 50% or less of the time
consumed by the Terminal pattern. Usually, all that is required is 25% of the time (give or take a few
percentage points). A Terminal pattern always completes a larger formation and the high or low it creates
should hold for approximately twice the time period ( or more) covered by the Terminal. If the Terminal
is the 5th wave of an Impulse pattern, usually the larger Impulse pattern will also be completely retraced.

One of the majorreasons the Elliott Wave Theory allows you to predict future price action with such
a high degree of accuracy (at times) is due to its strict limitation on where certain types of market behavior
can and cannot occur. The information in this section should help to further clarify a market's current
position and assist you in predicting its future activity. Specific pre- and post-market action requirements
are Hsted in this chapter to aid you in correctly linking one pattern with the next. This area of the Theory
should be dealt with only after all the elementary aspects of analysis are considered (i.e., Retracement,
Structure Series, Channeling, Alternation, Fibonacci relationships, etc.).
The proper application of Progress Labels requires a vast understanding of market behavior. The
minute you use a Progress Label on market action you instantly imply certain types of time, price,
structure, complexity, volume, velocity and momentum characteristics which must be inherent in the
market action labeled. These are not characteristics the beginning student could be expected to
instinctively understand. Obviously, the use of Progress Labels is much more involved than just looking
to see how much a move gets retraced.
To confidently place Progress Labels on price action you must understand the subtle implications
and slight differentiations of each Elliott pattern and its variations. As the market approaches the middle
of a Trending or Corrective Elliott pattern, it is especially important to deal with the basics of market
"Structure." Why? Because itis atthese times, more often than not, you will not be able to limit Progress
Label possibilities enough to arrive at only one scenario (or possibly, any scenario at all).
Advanced Progress Label Application 11-1
Only after you understand the rudiments of deciphering monowave market action as either Trending
or Corrective in nature, after you learn to Serialize the Structure of the monowaves and then learn how
to roughly correlate the action to Standardized Elliott patterns, are you ready for this section on Advanced
Progress Label Application. Progress labels are the final check on a proposed wave count. To properly
apply Progress Labels, it is required you check through a sometimes lengthy list of essential and subtle
criteria. This list will solidify the proposed combination of Trending and Corrective segments into larger,
legitimate Elliott patterns.
Each Progress Label's innate characteristics allow the knowledgeable Elliottician to finalize current
market structure and forecast future activity. They invoke form to a market's action and, due to their
ordered occurrence (i.e., 1,2,3,4,5,a,b,c), provide a road map (albeit, sometimes rough) of future market
behavior. [If this subject is new to you, it should be obvious why this area of the Theory could not be
discussed until now, after an understanding of each label's implications was presented to you.]
The next section is intended tohelp you accomplish the task of transforming your chart's wave
"Structure" into "Progress" labels as quickly and reliably as possible. A check list of attributes, which
must be considered every time you place a particular Progress Label on real-time market action, is
included in this next section. Each listing contains an array of characteristics which describe the
implications of each Progress label on past and future market action. Try to understand the concepts
behind these listings; they are all based on logical induction and deduction. Once the concepts are
understood, it will be as if you had memorized this entire section because you will be able to logically
explain the interactions of Elliott Wave price patterns.
Attempting what has never been attempted before, each Progress Label has been listed under each
type of Elliott pattern. It is through this list that I hope to eliminate the belief in the investment world
that Elliott Wave Theory allows too many possibilities and has too many exceptions to be viable.
Actually, the reverse is true, but until now no source provided you with this "process of elimination"
information.
Impulse Patterns
An Impulsion can transpire only in specific Progress Label positions. Never can waves-2, 4, b, d,
e, or x be an Impulse pattern.

Wave-1 Extended
The move that follows Extended wave-1 (wave-2) cannot retrace much more than 38.2% of wave1. Wave-2 will not likely be a Zigzag pattern. If you do see a Zigzag form.after the 1st wave Extension,
most likely it will be the completion of only wave-a of a larger Flat correction for wave-2. Wave-2cannot
be a Running correction. Wave-5 must be the shortest of the three thrust waves (1,3,5). Probabilities
greatly favor that wave-2 will be more complex and time-consuming than wave-4 and it is likely that it
will be the most complex and time consuming pattern in the entire series (1-5). If the pattern is above
polywave development, the probabilities greatly favor that wave-1 will be the subdivided wave (the most
complex of the three thrust segments). If wave-I is not the subdivided pattern, then it must be wave-3.
11-2 Advanced Progress Label Application
Wave-1 Non-extended
W ave-2 can retrace as much as 99% of wave-1. If it does, and wave-1 is a polywave or higher, the
2-wave will subdivide into an a-b-c affair in which the c-wave will fail (the 2-wave !lliU'. subdivide
whether the 1st wave does or not).
If you are witnessing the first wave-1 develop after a prolonged advance or decline, there are no
specific price level requirements for the termination of wave-1. If it is wave-1 of a larger 3rd or 5th wave,
then wave-I should approach (and preferably exceed) the termination point of the last Impulse wave of
one larger degree. The 3rd wave must be longer than wave-I. If the pattern is above Complexity level
1, the third or fifth wave will be the subdivided segment, notwave-1. This is not to imply wave-I will
not subdivide, it just means it will not be tru; subdivided wave of the group. In other words, wave-3 or
5 will be more subdivided.
Wave-2
If wave-I turns out to be ( or is believed to be) the longest wave in the sequence, the second wave
cannot retrace much more than 38.2% of the first wave. If the first wave is not the longest wave, the lowest
point of wave-2 can retrace as much as 99% of wave-1. Ifwave-1 is a polywave or higher, the 2-wave
must subdivide into a polywave or higher pattern. If the 2-wave subdivides and wave-a (in wave-2)
retraces more than 61.8% of wave-I, the entire correction will inevitably turn out to be a Double Failure
or a C-Failure, with the C-failure occurring at a point 61.8% or less of wave-I.
W ave-3 Extended
This is the most likely wave in a sequence to extend. Ifwave-(3) is also the subdivided wave, the
strongest tendency is for the 3rd wave of wave-(3) to also extend. To get a 3rd wave extension
immediately after wave-2 completes, without forming a smaller 2nd wave on the same chart, the 2nd
wave should be of Power level 1 (+or -) or higher. If the 3rd wave is a polywave, consecutively smaller
2nd-waves (before the explosive "3 of 3" move) will be similar in construction. Under those specific
conditions, it is mandatory that the smaller 2-waves take less time, less price and retrace less (as a
percentage of wave-I) than the larger 2-waves. Also, the larger 0-2 trendline should not be broken by
the smaller 2-wave correction. Always be aware that wave-5 can Fail if the 3rd wave extends.
Wave-3 Non-extended
When wave-3 is not the longest of the three thrust waves, either wave-I or wave-5 will be shorter
in price than wave-3. If wave-3 is shorter than wave-1, then wave-I will be the extended wave and wave5 will be shorter than wave-3. If wave-5 extended, wave-I would be shorter than wave-3. When the first
wave extends, wave-3 should complete no further away than 61.8% above (or below if the market is
trending down) from the end of wave-I.
Advanced Progress Label Application 11-3
Wave-4
If the 5th wave extends, wave-4 should be more complex, time-consuming, and possibly of one
greater complexity level than wave-2. If wave-1 extends, wave-4 should be simpler in price, time and
structure than wave-2. If the fifth wave extends, wave-4 should retrace a greater percentage of wave3 than wave-2 does of wave-1. Frequently wave-4 will retrace as much as 50-61.8% of wave-3 when
the 5th wave is the extension. If the fifth wave fails in the Impulse sequence, the fourth wave should be
the most complex pattern and should retrace more than 38.2% of wave-3 (as much as 61.8% is allowable).
W ave-5 Extended
Wave-5should be~ equal to the price distance from the beginning of wave-1 (point "O'')
through the end of wave-3 added to the end of wave-4. The maximum length of the 5th extension should
not exceed 261.8% of the length from "O" to the end of wave-3 added to the end of wave-3. When
considering waves-2 and 4, wave-4 should take the greatest amount of price/time and have the most
complex structure. Wave-1 should progress at the sharpest angle with wave-3 following closely behind
and wave-5 possessing the slowest rate of acceleration. A 5th wave extension cannot be completely
retraced unless it is the c-wave of a correction QI is the end of a larger 5th wave Extension.
Wave-5 Non-Extended
The 5th wave should be retraced close to 100% or more by the next corrective phase. If wave-1 extended in the sequence and the sequence concludes wave-(1) or wave-(a) of a larger Degree, the
correction after wave-5 should drop into the 2nd wave price wne. If the sequence completes wave-(3)
of a larger Degree, the correction after wave-5 will probably stop in the fourth wave zone.
5th Wave Failure
As a general rule, 5th wave Failures are only possible when the 3rd wave is the Extended move. The
4th wave should be the most complex of the two corrective phases. Wave-4 should retrace more of wave3 than wave-2does of wave-1. Almost always, wave-1 & 5 will be practically identical in price and time.
On fewer occasions, waves 1 & 5 will relate in price and/or ti!lle by 61.8%. A 5th wave can Fail in an
Impulse pattern only under one of the following circumstances:
A. If the Impulse pattern ( which contains the 5th wave Failure) is itself the 5th wave of a larger
Impulse pattern (see Figure 11-1).
B. If the Impulse pattern (containing the Failure) is the c-wave-of one (and only one) larger
Degree (see Figure 11-2).
C. Under extremely rare circumstances you might see a Iarger·3rchvave experience a smaller
5th wave Failure. For this to take place, the market would need to be forming a top or bottom
that is very significant. "Significant" is, of course, a relative term. In this situation it would mean a
Multi wave pattern, or preferably higher. If you witness an event such as this, the larger 5th Wave will
also have to Fail, and it must Fail even further away from a high or low than the wave-5 Failure within
11-4 Advanced Progress Label Application
the 3rd wave. To have wave-5 Fail at the end of a larger 3rd wave would indicate exceptional counter
trend power. After such an event, a long-term top or bottom should be in place. Note: Even though it
cannot be absolutely ruled out, the author has never seen a 5th wave Failure at the end of a larger 3rd
wave. Through logical deduction and a long-termfamiliarity with wave behavior, it is reasonable to
assume that the conclusions above are valid for such a situation.

Terminal
_,111111111111111111111111111111111
This type of pattern was referred to by Elliott as a "Diagonal Triangle." To avoid any incorrect
association of "Diagonal Triangles" with "Horizontal Triangles," I decided it was necessary to retitle the
pattern. The new phrase, "Terminal Impulse," is a more accurate description of the pattern and its
implications. I apologize to the reader who is accustomed to the old term, but I had to approach this
subject with the idea that the reader is completely inexperienced. This new term should provide you with
a better understanding of the phenomenon and its place in the larger scheme. Since Terminal and
Triangle patterns consist of the same Structure Series, they tend to exhibit similar behavior characteristics. The deciding factor is that Terminal patterns adhere to all of the Essential Impulse Construction
Rules; it is impossible for a Horizontal Triangle to follow all the same Rules. [For diagrams of Terminal
pattern variations, refer to Chapter 5, pages 14-15]
Wave-1 Extended
A 1st wave extension in a Terminal pattern is by far the most common setup. Measured from its
termination point, wave-2 should not retrace more than 61.8% of wave-1. Wave-3 should not be much
more than 61.8% ofwave-1, but at least 38.2% ofwave-1. Wave-5 cannot be more than 99% ofwave3, but will more likely be only 61.8% to 38.2%. Wave-4 will usually be 61.8% ofwave-2 in price and
equal or relate by 61.8% in time. The 2-4 trendline should be clean and easy to identify. The only way
the 2-4 trendline can experience a 'false break' (under these circumstances) is if the 5th wave is an
Elongated Flat, a correction experiencing a C-Failure or a Horizontal Triangle or a c-wave Terminal
within the 5th wave.
Wave-1 Non-extended
Wave-2 can retrace as much as 99% ofwave-1. When the 1st wave does not extend, the Terminal
pattern will most likely be the c-wave of a correction (excluding the c-wave of a Triangle), not the fifth
wave of an Impulse pattern.
Wave-2
If the first wave extends, wave-2 should not terminate at a point lower than 61.8% of wave-1. If the
first wave does not extend, wave-2 can retrace up to 99% of wave-1. If the first wave extends, wave2 should consume more time and price than wave-4 and be the most complicated of the two corrections.
W ave-3 Extended
This constitutes one of the rarest possible wave patterns. When wave-3 "extends" in a Terminal
pattern (unlike all other instances), it cannot be much longer than the first wave. Wave-2 must retrace
more than 61.8% of the first wave and the fourth wave should retrace 38.2% (preferably less) of the third
wave. The 2-4 trendline should perform as usual. A 1-5 trendline slwuld be drawn which will be broken
by the third wave. The fifth wave should not be more than 61.8% ofwave-3. You will probably only
see this pattern as the c-wave of a sequence, not the 5th wave of an Impulse pattern.
11-6 Advanced Progress Label Application
Wave-3 Non-extended
If wave-3 does not extend, the probabilities are considerably in favor of the first wave being the
extension. If the first wave extended, wave-3 should not be much more than 61.8% of the first wave and
wave-5 should not be much more than 61.8% ofwave-3. Ifwave-1 is smaller than wave-3 (but not less
than 61.8%) the 5th wave will probably extend. This would entail wave-4 overlapping wave-1, wave4 being larger in price and/or time than wave-2. The 5th wave should be at least equal to 1-3 in price added
to the low of wave-4. The 5th wave should not be more than 161.8% of waves 1-3 added to the top of
wave-3.
Wave-4
Wave-4 cannot retrace more than 61.8% of wave-3 unless the fifth wave is going to extend and even
then, it is extremely rare. If the fifth wave extends, wave-4 will probably take more time and price than
"'.ave-2 and consist of more subdivisions than wave-2. Wave-2 and 4 will likely relate by 61.8% in price
and/or time.
W ave-5 Extended
This setup should only occur if the Terminal comprises the 5th wave of a larger Impulse pattern in
which that 5th wave is also the extended wave w: when the Terminal is the c-wave of any correction
except a Horizontal Triangle. To segregate this pattern from an Expanding Running Triangle, some
important observations are necessary. Unlike an Expanding Running Triangle, a Terminal must drift
slightly upward if the trend of one larger degree is up, making higher highs for waves 1-3 & 5 and higher
lows for waves 2 & 4 (vice versa if the trend is down). In an Expanding Running Triangle, the first leg
must be shorter than the second. The 5th wave of the 5th Extension Terminal pattern should be at least
100% of waves-1 & 3, while wave-3 should not be more than 161.8% of wave-1. Wave-4 should retrace
at least half of wave-3 and can retrace up to 99% (even though that is highly unlikely).
Wave-5 Non-Extended
If the 5th wave is not extended, it should not be more than 61.8% ofwave-3. It should not be of the
highest complexity of the three thrust waves. The 5th wave should break beyond the trendline drawn
across waves 1 & 3. The 2-4 trendline should be "clean" and will not be broken until after wave-5 is
complete (unless wave-5 is a Triangle). Wave-4 should consume less time and price than wave-2.
Corrective Patterns
To avoid repeating the same statements under each section, it should be known that no Corrective
pattern can occur in any Trendjne Impulse Progress Label position (i.e., wave-I, 3, 5, wave-a in a
Zigzag, or wave-c in a Zigzag or Flat [all variations]). The corrective patterns begin on the next page
with Flats.
Advanced Progress Label Applica#on 11-7
Flats
_,111111111111111111111111111111111
Flat patterns have many ways of manifesting themselves depending on the subtle differences of
strength between one pattern and the next. All the patterns that fall under the broad heading of Flats are
composed of the same Structure Series [3,3,5] (i.e. two adjacent corrective segments followed by a third
Impulsive segment). Previously, we dealt with minimum requirements and maximum limits of Flat
patterns. In this section, a little more detail will be covered along with the specific implications of each
situation.
Variations of the Flat theme appear when the b-wave begins to retrace more than 100% or less than
100% of wave-a. The larger wave-bis in relation to wave-a, the less wave-c will retrace of wave-band
the more similar wave-c and wave-a will be to each other. The less wave-b retraces of wave-a, the larger
wave-c will become. In Figure 11-3, the three diagrams show how wave-c can act based on various bwave retracements of wave-a from 100% to 61 8%. (Keep in mind, these are minimum requirements
for the length of the c-wave in relation to wave-b depending on how much wave-b retraces of wave-a.)
B-Failure
This term describes a pattern where the a-wave is Corrective, but the b-wave retraces.Qll.U'. 61.8- 81 %
of wave-a (see Figure 11-4).
The inability of wave-b to retrace more than 81 % of wave-a indicates temporary weakness in the
market. When wave-bis that weak, you can expect wave-c (as long as it is Impulsive) to retrace at least
61.8% ofwave-b.
AB-Failure almost always takes place when the a-wave is a Double Zigzag or Double Combination
(completing with a Triangle). It is characterized by the b-waveretracingatleast61.8%, but less than 81 %
of wave-a. The c-wave in a B-Failure pattern must retrace all of wave-b or else the pattern falls into the
Double Failure category. No specific Fibonacci price relationships are required between waves-a,b or
c, but wave-a & c may relate by 61.8%. Waves-a & b should alternate in time, construction and
complexity to the extent possible based on the time consumed by each. This pattern can occur as:
Waves: Any 2,4,a,b
Waves: c,d,e of a Horizontal Triangle
Part of a rare Running Double Flat
C-Failure
AC-wave Failure occurs whenever wave-c fails to retrace all of wave-b. This usually, but not
always, occurs when wave-b retraces all, or almost all, of wave-a. AC-wave Failure is definitely a sign
of counter trend strength (refer to Figure 11-5).
When a C-wave Failure occurs: the c-wave should oefiilitely not be the shortest "time pattern" in the
correction and very frequently it will consume the longest period of time of the three Corrective
segments. Additionally, it can be equal to wave-a or wave-b (see Figure 11-6, bottom of next page).
When a C-wave Failure occurs, it quite frequently will be a Terminal Impulse. A Terminal Impulse
is the perfect way to consume time without damaging price levels (see Figure 11-7, to of page 11-11).

In a C-Failure pattern, the b-wave should subdivide more completely than wave-a. Usually it will
be a Double Zigzag. The c-wave should be either 61.8% of wave-a DI complete in a zone 61.8% of
wave-a taken from the beginning of wave-a. The b-wave must not exceed the highest point of wave-a.
If it does, refer to Irregular Failures. The c-wave must, of course, be Impulsive (5). This pattern can
occur as:
Wave: Any 2, 4, a, b
Wave: 5 (of a Terminal Impulse)

Common
Figure 11-9 illustrates the typical shape of a Flat pattern. In a Common pattern, all of the waves will
be approximately equal in price (see Figure 11-9).
The Common can occur at virtually anytime in a sequence where the pattern needs to be corrective.
Wave-b should not be more than 100% of wave-a, but must retrace at least 81 % of wave-a and wavec must retrace all of wave-b. Wave-c should move slightly beyond the end of wave-a, but not by more
than 10 or 20%. It is not a terrifically strong pattern, but it does imply more strength than a Zigzag.
Alternation of time, construction, and complexity are the most important considerations. Wave-b
will, the majority of the time, be the most time-consuming of the three segments and will be more
subdivided (complex) than wave-a. Wave-c must be Impulsive.

Double Failure
This describes the infrequent situation where the b-wave fails to retrace more than 81 % of wave-a
.!ID.!! the c-wave fails to retrace all of wave-b (see Figure 11-10). It can generally only take place if the
a-wave is a Double Combination, followed by a strong Zigzag for wave-b. Wave-c would fail to retrace
all of wave-b. Another possibility is that wave-a will be a Triple Combination and the b-wave will be
a Double Zigzag or Combination. This would prevent the c-wave from retracing all of wave-b (reasons
for this were discussed in Chapter 10, Advanced Logic Rules); refer to Figure 11-11 for details.
Frequently, the a-wave of a Flat will help to create the appearance of a Double Failure (see
Emulation). This usually occurs when the a-wave is a Double Combination pattern completing with
a Horizontal Triangle (study Figure 11-12).
In a general sense, this pattern will resemble a Horizontal Triangle because of the continual exhibition
of contraction. Close attention to price detail is essential in deciding whether you are in a B-Failure or
Horizontal Triangle. In a B-Failure, the c-wave is an Impulse pattern. In a Horizontal Triangle, the cwave is a Corrective pattern. Virtually without exception, the a-wave in one of these patterns will be a
Double Zigzag or Double Combination (a pattern concluding with a Non-Limiting Triangle). The cwave will generally be 61.8% of wave-a or terminate in a price zone 61.8% of wave-a subtracted from
the beginning of wave-a. Places of acceptable formation:
Wave: Any 2,4
Wave: a (in an Irregular or Triangle pattern)
Wave: b (of a Zigzag, Common, or Elongated pattern)

Elongated Aats are very important, early warning signs of triangular formation. Once you witness

this pattern, wave-a& b must be similar in price (wave-b must retrace at least 61.8% of wave-a) and will

Irregular
This is one of the easiest patterns to define and recognize. Some readers may be astounded to read
this, but on a real-time, properly plotted Cash chart, this pattern is DQt very common. Following are the
parameters which outline this type of pattern.
Minimum Requirements:
1. Wave-b must be at least 101 % of wave-a. (see Figure 11-17)
2. Wave-c must be at least 101% ofwave-b. (see Figure 11-18)

Advanced Progress Label Application 11-15
,!\s the b-wave gets longer (in relation to wave-a), the probabilities dropped dramatically that wavec will be longer than wave-b. An Irregular pattern must adhere to the following Rules.
Maximum Limits:
1. The b-wave should not exceed 138.2% of the length of wave-a. If it does, the pattern will
~ not be an Irregular, but an Irregular Failure (see next heading). In other words, wavec will not retrace all of wave-b. If the b-wave is more than 138.2% of wave-a, the c-wave
is not likely to retrace all of wave-b; in that case the pattern will have to be called an
Irregular Failure (refer to Figure 11-19)
2. The b-wave in an Irregular Correction should subdivide more than wave-a (see Figure 11-19).
The b-wave will almost always be a Zigzag (or less likely, a combination of corrections), while wavea will usually be some type of Flat. The c-wave must be Impulsive. If wave-c is corrective, you may
be experiencing an Expanding Triangle w: a Contracting Triangle with a large c-wave. This pattern can be found as:
Wave: Any 2,4,a,b
Wave: c,d,e (in a Horizontal Triangle)

wave-a As long as wave-b does not exceed 123.6% of
wave-a, it is still possible for wave-c to make a
move beyond the end of wave-a If it is any longer,
the c-wave will have a tough time being bigger than
wave-b (thus moving beyond the end of wave-a).
Irregular Failure
This pattern starts to become~ likely when the b-wave exceeds 138.2% of wave-a (see Figure 11-
20). As the b-wave becomes longer, wave-a and wave-c become more similar (see Figure 11-21). This
pattern signals post market-action strength. Wave-b must be larger than wave-a in price. Wave-c must
not retrace all of wave-b. Wave-c will generally relate to the a-wave (price and time) by equality or the
Fibonacci ratio. This pattern should occur as one of the Progress Labels below:
Wave: 2,4 (before an extended wave)
Wave: b (before an Elongated c-wave of a Flat)
Wave: b (of a Zigzag in which wave-c is at least 161.8% of wave-a)

Running
The most powerful Standard Correction, the Running, imposes very specific requirements on post
market action. It is essential that the movement after a Running correction advances ( or declines) quicker
than the pattern immediately before the Running correction (of the same degree). The movement
immediately after a Running Correction should always be the longest segment of the completed Elliott
pattern. Places where Running Corrections can occur: ,
Wave: 2 (right before an Extended 3rd wave)
Wave: 4 (right before an Extended 5th wave)- consider this rare
Wave: b (right before an Elongated c-wave and in which the whole a-b-c is probably the entire leg
of a Triangle or one of the completed phases of a Complex Correction which is the entire leg
of a Triangle)
Wave: b (ina Zigzag that is part of a Triangle [of only one or two Degrees higher])
Wave: x ( to be considered very unlikely, but could occur right before the longest Corrective group
of a Complex corrective series)
In a Running Correction, wave-b must be the largest wave by far. Wave-a and wave-c will tend
toward equality in price and time. The b-wave does not have to relate to wave-a but, if it does it will
probably be 261.8% of wave-a (for more detail on Running Correction, refer back to Chapter 5).

ZigZags
-111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
Unlike Flats, Zig7.ags do not come in as many variations. Their construction and requirements are
few, but demanding. The two areas of significant consideration for Zigzag patterns are: how long is the
c-wave is in relation to the a-wave; and how much does wave-c subdivide in relation to wave-a? The
following diagrams have been drawn to show how these and other rules (when considered simultaneously) go to form realistic Zigzag patterns (see Figure 11-22).
Wave-a
Wave-a must be an Impulse structure and should not be retraced by wave-b more than 61.8%. If you
are certain that the a-wave is Impulsive, but the b-wave retraces more than 61.8%, then thatretracement
will only be the a-wave (ofone smaller degree) ofwave-B in which thee-wave (ofwave-B) will fail. If
part of the B-wave retraces 81% or more of wave-a, then you should recheck your analysis of wave-a.
It will most likely fall under the Missing Wave Rule in which wave-a (that at a glance only looked
Impulsive) is better interpreted as a Corrective Double Zigzag or Double Combination.

Wave-b
Wave-b absolutely must be corrective (3) and should not retrace more than 61.8% of wave-a when
measured from its terminus. It should not be a Running Correction unless the Zigzag, of which the bwave is a part, is in a Triangle. If what you think is wave-b turns out to be a Running Correction, most
likely it is wave-2 of an Impulse wave. Wave-b can be almost any other Corrective pattern in a Zigzag
except a Double or Triple Zigzag or a Running Double or Triple Flat and their Combinations. If you see
one of those patterns forming after an Impulsive a-wave (which is in a Zigzag), then the Complex
movement will only be part of the b-wave correction, not the whole correction.
Wave-c
When a Zigzag ( of which wave-c is a part) is not part of a Triangle ( of only one or two higher degrees),
its price length should fall between 61.8% and 161.8% of wave-a. If the whole Zigzag is part of a Triangle
(ofonly one or two higher degrees), the c-wave can exceed those limits, but is not required to do so. If
the c-wave exceeds those limits, it is one of the betterindications of Triangular fonnation ( of one or two
higher degrees).
Triangles
-IIIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
After years of experience with real-time market analysis and trading, it was clear that Elliott's rules
concerning Triangles were not comprehensive enough to describe all market consolidation phases
which occurred between converging trendlines. It became evident there needed to be a subdivision of
the two general Triangular categories (Contracting and Expanding). The first sub-category I call
Limiting Triangles. These make up the well known types that Elliott described: b-waves and 4th-waves.
As their name implies, these Triangles have a limiting effect on post-Triangular market action.
The other Triangle sub-category I designated Non-Limiting. These make up a relatively unknown
type which occur in unusual places in a wave sequence. Non-limiting Triangles impose only minor post
market action limitations. Theformation of these Triangles is slightly different from the Limiting type.
Close attention to detail is necessary to properly detect which type of Triangle is forming. Both types
will be discussed during the next few pages.
All of the rules which follow are in reference to Triangles. Learning to decipher polywave activity
is at the root of the entire Theory, so most of the rules were designed with polywaves in mind, but the
rules can be carried iilto.the multi- and macrowave arenas.
Note: Under no circumstances is wave-d the largest wave of w Triangle pattern. Under no
circumstances can three legs ( of the same degree) within a Triangle be equal in price (give or take 5% ).
In Expanding Triangles, only four of a possible five retracements (including the pattern of the same
degree just before the Triangle started) needs to be 100% or more; one of the five may not be completely
retraced. Never can any leg (other than wave-e) of a Contracting Triangle be, itself, a Contracting
Triangle. When mentioned in later text that an a, b, c, or d-wave can be any Corrective pattern, it means
any Corrective pattern mild a Triangle (unless otherwise mentioned).
Advanced Progress Label Application 11-19
Contracting Triangles
Contracting Triangles are the most common Triangular formation. They come in two major
categories, Limiting and Non-Limiting, with each category breaking down into several varieties.
I. Limiting
It is crucial, if you want to master Elliott, that you understand the difference between the general
make-up of a Limiting and Non-Limiting Triangle. All Limiting Triangles have a very similar
construction. One of the most important characteristics is that wave-e, the end of the Triangle, concludes
well before the apex point of the Triangle is reached (see Figure 11-23).
Another element, which I have discovered is characteristic of Limiting Triangles, deals with time.
The apex of the Triangle should complete in a time zone equal to 20-40% of the time consumed by the
Triangle added to the end of thee-wave (refer to Figure 11-24).
The apex of the Triangle has the greatest tendency to complete around the 38.2% [.6182 (squared)]
time wne. As mentioned earlier, after a Triangle is complete, it produces what is called a" thrust." The
extent of the thrust is the key factor in the proper categorization of Triangles. In Limiting Triangles, the
thrust is usually limited to the widest leg of the Triangle (+or - 25% ). Only in rare cases, or when the

Triangle falls into the "abnormal" classification, can the "thrust'' exceed the above limits. A state of
abnormality occurs when the Triangle fails to follow the parameters discussed in Figure 11-25. Rare
cases occur if the Triangle is the last b-wave or 4th-wave before a final 1DiUQ! top or bottom in the market.
Contracting Limiting Triangles take place in only two Progress Label positions; as wave-4 or waveb. These are the best known types and are the ones which Elliott discovered. There are other types of
Triangles which Elliott did not discover. Immediately following are the different types of Contracting,
Limiting Triangles. Afterwards, we will proceed into the less known worlds of Expanding and Non-
~ Triangles.
a. Horizontal
Each leg of this type of Triangle should be at least 38.2% of the previous leg (excluding wave-e).
Wave-b can be no more than 261.8% of wave-a and wave-c can be no more than 161.8% of wave-b.
Wave-d must be shorter than wave-c and wave-e must be shorter than wave-d.
Wave-a
Wav~::addes- not have to be the largest segment (price-wise), but it should definitelfnotbethe
smallest wave of the pattern. If wave-a is not the largest wave, wave-b almost certainly ~ill be. ~eawave should not be less than 50% of wave-b. If wave-a is smaller than wave-b, wave-a will most likely
be a type of Flat and wave-b a Zigzag or if wave-a is a simple Zigzag, wave-b will m~st lik~ly be a
complex Corrective pattern (Double Zigzag or Combination, Running Double Flat • a Tnple Zigzag or
Combination is not verylike!y to occur in wave-b of this type of Triangle).
Wave-b
If wave-bis smaller in price than wave-a, then all the other patterns must be smaller than the previ?us
segment (from left to right). If wave-bis bigger than wave-a, the chances are very small (but do e~1st)
that wave-c may be slightly larger than wave-band still maintain the Contracting Triangle formatton.
If the c-wave is larger than wave-b, it is mandatory that wave-d be smaller than wave-c or else you are
Advanced Progress Label Application 11-21
en~ering the Expanding Triangle realm and should move to that section. In other words, in this type of
Tnangle, once one segment is smaller in price than the last, all the rest must be smaller than the previous.
If this is not the _case, then the market is not in a Contracting Horizontal Triangle. Maybe it is in some
other type ofTnangle. Note: Wave-b should not be less than 38.2% or more than 261.8% of wave-a.
There may be exceptions to the foregoing guidelines, but they are rare, so be careful about ignoring them.
Wave-c
. V"! ave-c is the last :,vave that has a chance (in a Contracting Horizontal Limiting Triangle) to be larger
m pnce than the previous wave (wave-b). It rarely happens, but it is not impossible. If wave-c is the
biggest price move, the trendline will be drawn across wave-c & e. -
Wave-d
Wave-d must be shorter than wave-c. It should be at least 38.2% ofwave-c. It may take more time
than ~ave-c, but should not be of greater complexity level ( the same complexity level or one lower level,
only, 1s acceptable).
Wave-e
Wave-e must be shorter in price than wave-d. It can be shorter or longer in time than wave-d, but
should not be the longest ~ Correction in the pattern.
b. I"egular
. The Irregular Triangle is characterized by the b-wave of the pattern, which must be longer (pricew1se) than wave-a. After wave-b, all waves are continuously smaller until the Triangle is over.
Wave-a
With few exceptions, the a-wave should be smaller iiitiine than the b=wave. The b--wave should not
be more than 161.8% of wave-a (price-wise). Wave-c must move back into the price "zone" of waveb enough so that the shorter e-wave can also finish in the price zone of wave-b. The a-wave can be any
corrective pattern except a Triple Zigzag or an Elongated Flat. To avoid confusion, I will once again
mention that wave a,b,c, or d of a Triangle can never, itself, be a Triangle. Thee-wave is the only segment
of a Triangle allowed to form into a smaller Triangle.
Wave-b
The b=wave must be longer than wave-a. It will probably not be much more than 161.8% of wavea and!lllJ.il.llQ1 be more than 261.8% of wave-a. If wave-a does not subdivide, the b=wave will most likely
be a Zigzag. If wave-a subdivides into a Zigzag, then wave-b will probably be a Double Zigzag. If wave11-22 Advanced Progress Label Application
a was a Flat, wave-b will probably be a single Zigzag. The b-wave should not be more than 61.8% of
the previous Impulse wave. The b-wave ~ any Flat or Zigzag pattern. It can be any Complex
Correction such as a Double or Triple or a Combination.
Wave-c
Wave-c must be shorter than wave-b, but must retrace at least 38.2% of wave-b. The lowest point
of wave-c will probably fall back into the price zone of wave-a. If wave-b was a Double Zigzag, wavec should be a Zigzag or a Flat with an Elongated c-wave. If wave-b was a Zigzag, then wave-c will
probably be a Flat (of any type) or a rnonowave.
Wave-d
Wave-d must be shorter than wave-c. It may consume more time than wave-c. It must retrace at least
38.2% of wave-c. The d-wave can be any Corrective pattern as long as it Alternates with wave-c.
Wave-e
Thee-wave must be smaller than wave-d and the probabilities greatly favor that thee-wave will be
the smallest wave (price wise) in the Triangle. It does not have to retrace the d-wave by any specific
amount, but it must move in the opposite direction of the d-wave by at least one tick and must terminate
in the price zone of wave-d.
Unlike the other four segments in the Triangle (waves a,b,c,d), thee-wave can, itself, be a Triangle,
but, e-wave Triangles are far more common at the end of Non-limiting Triangles than at the end of
Limiting Triangles. The terminal point of thee-wave will probably fall at an important Fibonacci point
to the pattern of one larger degree. If the pattern of one larger degree is a Zigzag (which means the
Triangle is a B-wave), then thee-wave terminus will probably be at 61.8% of the entire move from the
start of the Zigzag to its end added to the start of the Zigzag. If the larger pattern is a Flat, thee-wave
terminus will probably be at 61.8% of wave-a of the Flat If the Tria.'lgle is the 4th wave of an Impulse
pattern, thee-wave terminus will likely occur at 38.2% or 61.8% of the a-wave of the Triangle.
c. Running
The Running Triangle is detected from the b & d-wave action. Wave-b will be longer than wavea and wave-d will be longer than wavecc. The thrust out of this type ofTriangle will be more than normal.
It should be at least 161.8% of the widest segment of the Triangle, but should not exceed 261.8%. When
this type of Triangle occurs, frequently it signals that the end of a significant advance or decline is about
to take place. If the thrust out of the Triangle were more than 200%, then you can be relatively sure that
a significant top or bottom will take place.
Advanced Progress Label Application 11-23
Wave-a
Wave-a should be no less than 38.2% ofwave-b. Wave-a will probably be a monowave or a Flat.
If it is a Zigzag, then wave-b will need to be a Double (and maybe a Triple) Zigzag. In this type of
Triangle, wave-a cannot be a Double or Triple Zigzag, a Triangle, or a Flat with an Elongated c-wave.
The most common type of Correction for wave-a would be a monowave or any Flat ( excluding Elongated
Flats). Wave-a must not retrace more than 61.8% of the previous pattern (if an Impulse wave preceded
the Triangle). To do so would indicate weakness and would be a contradiction of the strength implied
by the Running Triangle. Normally, the a-wave should not retrace much more than 38.2% of the
previous Impulse pattern (if one is present).
Wave-b
If there is an Impulsive a-wave before a Running b-wave Triangle, wave-b should not be more than
261.8% of wave-a. Unless all the segments of the Triangle are monowaves, wave-b should be a Zigzag,
a Double Zigzag, or on a rare occasion, a Triple Zigzag. Wave-b must be the largest segment of the
Triangle, so obviously wave-c cannot retrace all of wave-b. If wave-a is a Flat, wave-b will probably
take less time than wave-a. If wave-a is anything else (including a monowave ), wave-b should consume
more time.
Wave-c
Wave-c must be shorter than wave-b. Wave-c cannot be more complicated than a Double Zigzag or
Double Combination. It cannot be a Triple Zigzag. The probabilities are very high that the terminus
of wave-c will fall back into the price zone covered by wave-a.
Wave-d
Wave-d must be larger (in price) than wave-c. This, of course, means that it will exceed the terminus
of wave-b. Wave-d should not be a Triple Zigzag. It could be virtually any other corrective pattern.
Wave-d must not be completely retraced by wave-e. Due to the strong move that should occur
immediately after wave-e, the terminus of wave-e should not be at a point which would put it at more
than a 61.8% retracement of wave-d. If part of wave-e retraces more than 61.8% of wave-d, thee-wave
will develop into a Flat with a C-Failure oron a rare occasion, thee-wave could be a Contracting Triangle
as long as it did not congest directly into the apex point of the converging lines (see the discussion on
the construction of Limiting Horizontal Triangles).
Wave-e
Wave-e must be smaller than wave-din price. It &QlJld take a longer period of time than wave-d,
especially if it were a Triangle, as long as it did not correct into the apex of the larger Triangle (see the
construction parameters of a Horizontal Triangle). If the Running Triangle created a larger b-wave, it
would be very common for the terminus of wave-e to occur at a 61.8% or 38.2% position to the entire
larger Corrective advance (Figure 11-26, top of next page).

II. Non-Limiting Triangles
Some of my most important discoveries concern Non-Limiting Triangles (Triangles that fall outside
of the 4th & b-wave realm). Understanding how a Non-Limiting forms is crucial to the proper analysis
of complex Corrections. In addition, it virtually eliminates being tricked into thinking a Triangle, that
is part of a Double or Triple Combination, is a 4th orb-wave. Non-Limiting Triangles occur at the ms!
of complex Corrections (Double and Triple Combinations of all types), as X-waves, Wave-e of a larger
Triangle, or as the 5th wave of a Terminal Impulse pattern. The most reliable indication of a NonLimiting Triangle occurs when the market contracts right into the apex of the converging trendlines (see
Figure 11-27). This condition is best met when thee-wave, of the larger Non-Limiting Triangle, is also
a Non-Limiting Triangle. As a general rule, Non-Limiting Triangles are easier to spot than Limiting
Triangles. This is due to their tendency to consolidate longer, letting everyone "know" a Triangle is
forming. It is then up to you to decide if the break out will be approximately equal to or greater than the
widest wave of the Triangle and whether the thrust will be up or down.

Advanced Progress Label Application 11-25
Due to Elliott's original guidelines, many students get caught incorrectly positioned in the market
when a Non-Limiting Triangle occurs. Elliott never wrote about Triangle's which could occur in any
other position except the b-wave and 4th-wave Progress Label position. This leaves many practitioners
in a dangerous situation. They assume all Triangles are 4th-waves orb-waves. Remember, b-waves and
4th-waves do not provide thrusts of much greater distance than the widest segment of the triangle. NonLimiting Triangles m.nm bound to that Rule. For this reason, a person trying to pick the end of the thrust,
out of what is asswned to be ab-wave or 4th-wave Triangle, may get caught in a persistent up or down
move if the Triangle actually was a Non-Limiting Triangle.
All the above rules which apply to Limiting Triangles under each specific category also apply to NonLimiting Triangles of the same type. For example, each leg in an Irregular Limiting would follow the
same rules as those outlined for Irregular Non-Limiting Triangles. There are only a few additional
behavior characteristics which need to be mentioned; they are listed by Progress Labels.
Wave-a
In these patterns, wave-a is almost always the most violent segment of the Triangle (i.e., it covers the
most price distance in the shortest period of time). Usually, the a-wave will be the most violent market
action to have occurred for quite sometime. The reason for this appears to be that these Triangles retrace
Corrective patterns, not Impulsive patterns. A severe and violent retracement of a Correction would be
more acceptable and logical than the same event after an Impulse pattern. If wave-a is violent, then waveb should break down into a much more complex and slower developing wave.
Wave-e
The last segment of a Non-Limiting Triangle, wave-e, has a strong tendency to be a Non-Limiting
Triangle itself. This creates a Triangle at the end of a larger Triangle. That is the best way for the market
to converge right into the apex of the larger Triangle's contracting trendlines.
Of the three types of Non-Limiting Triangles, the Horizontal is the one you will most often see in
real-time market action. For a more complete explanation of how Triangles should look and behave preand DQfil- thrust, refer to all sections that mention Triangles in Chapters 5 & 10.
NOTE: Any Non-Limiting Triangle (except when it is an x-wave) must terminate a larger corrective
phase. If you spot one in any position (other than the x-wave position), you can compactthe entire larger
move into a single !3'.
Some common and uncommon places of Non-Limiting Triangular occurrences are:
1. Wave-e of a Horizontal Triangle (return to the previous Figure 11-27).
2. The last corrective phase of a Double or Triple Three (see Figure 11-28).
3. The last corrective phase of a Running Double Three, one of the trickiest and most
common points of occurrence (see FigureU-29).
4. The last corrective phase of a Double or Triple Combination (refer to Figure 11-30).
5. The 5th wave of a Terminal Impulse (study Figure 11-31).
6. The x-wave of a complex Correction (see Figure 11-32).
If you did not notice, the above statements for numbers 1-5 indicate points of Triangular occurrence that
terminate a pattern. Number 6 lists the only time a Non-Limiting Triangle can occur in the middle of
a move.

A Non-Limiting Triangle in the Xwave position is the only time this
type of Triangle does not terminate a
larger Corrective pattern. It happens
right in the middle of the pattern.
EXJ)anding Triangles
Of all the wave patterns under Elliott's Theory, the Expanding Triangle creates the most treacherous
trading environment Much worse than its non-trending mirror image (the Contracting Triangle), this
pattern continually creates the illusion the market is breaking out. This is quickly met with a reversal
and then the break of a support or resistance level on the other side of the trading range. The phrase "whipsawed" was probably created by a trader experiencing this formation.
To improperly diagnose this pattern can cause severe financial "pain." Unfortunately, there is no way
to anticipate the formation of one of these patterns. On the other hand, strict and proper application of
all the rules and techniques discussed in this book should keep you out of the market since you will not
be able to decipher what is taking place. Lack of a clear pattern formation is the ultimate "no action"
indicator.
From the very few Expanding Triangles I have witnessed over the past eight years, a clear, specific
consensus of their nature has been difficult to distill. Instead oflisting their behavior on a wave-by-wave
basis under each variation, more general descriptions have been settled upon.
Before moving on, the major formational parameters of all Expanding Triangles need to be covered
so you can check your wave group against these "standard" guidelines to see if your assumption is on
the right track.
1. Either wave-a or wave-b will be the smallest segment of the Triangle.
2. Thee-wave has a tendency to "blow off," being much longer in price
and time than the other waves.
Advanced Progress Label Applicallon 11-29
3. In the same way (and for the same reasons) a Contracting Triangle can occur as thee-wave of
a~ Contracting Triangle, an Expanding Triangle can take place as the e-wave of a larger
Expanding Triangle.
4. As a general statement, watch for a progression from simple to complex (on a time and
subdivision scale) as each larger wave of the Expanding Triangle unfolds.
5. The pattern after the Triangle (wave-c or wave-5) should not completely retrace thee-wave.
6. One of the strangest aspects of Expanding Triangles appears to be their lack of numerous
Fibonacci relationships typical of Contracting Triangles. Generally, only one relationship can
be found, and you usually have to really search to find it Included under each heading is the one
relationship which seems to normally occur in the pattern listed. If there is no relationship
indicated, it is because I have not been able to identify any present in the ones that were studied.
Believe it or not, lack of Fibonacci relationships can be a valuable test of the authenticity of an
Expanding Triangle. It is very difficultforfive adjacent waves to form in such a way as not to
have mu: ( or even only one) Fibonacci relationships. From the information available, it seems
correct to say if there is more than one relationship present in a group of Expanding monowaves
(or higher), a pattern other than an Expanding Triangle is probably taking place.
7. Expanding Triangles cannot take place immediately before any powerful pattern such as a 1st,
3rd or 5th wave extension, or an Elongated c-wave. They cannot terminate Double or Triple or
Combination Running Three Corrections. It also cannot be the b-wave of a Zigzag, and will not
likely occur as the x-wave of any pattern.
8. In order to draw the trendlines to view the pattern correctly, the typical b-d trendline should be
employed, with the opposing trendline always drawn across wave-a and wave-c.
I. Limiting
The Expanding Limiting Triangle can be in the 4th QI b-wave position. If it is ab-wave, it can only
be part of a Flat. This Triangle as the b-wave of a Zigzag, the x-wave of a Complex Correction, or the
b-wave of a larger Triangle appears to be impossible. Of the two Progress Label possibilities, the b-wave
Expanding Triangle seems to be far more common than the 4th wave of the same makeup.
The Triangle's apex point, created by the~ trendlines, occurs backwards in time. Its position,
in relation to the whole Triangle, is important in the verification of it's Limiting status. This is how the
calculations sholllQ _be done:
1. Measure the entire time duration of the Expanding Triangle from the beginning of wave-a to the
end of wave-e.
2. Take 20% of that amount and add it to the end of wave-a going backwards in time. If the apex
point occurs before that time period, the Triangle should be considered "limiting" in its
implications. In other words, it will be ab-wave or 4th wave pattern, and the "urrust" out of the
Triangle will be very limiied, lt should be less than the length of thee-wave.
The following are general formation rules which should be present in all variations of Limiting
Triangles:
1. Waves-a & e will usually relate by 161.8% (wave-e, of course, the larger of the two).
2. Either wave-a or wave-b will be the shortest leg of the Triangle.
3. Only wave-b or wave-d can "Fail" to exceed the end of the previous wave.
11-30 Advanced Progress Label Application
a. Horiz,ontal
These are the distinctive features which make up an Expanding Limiting Horizontal Triangle
pattern:
1. Wave-a is the smallest segment or the Triangle.
2. Each wave, after wave-a, is slightly larger than the previous, so there is no "failure".
3. Thee-wave should be the most violent, complex and time-consuming pattern of the group.
4. The only Fibonacci relationship that appears to be reliable in this variation is between wave-a and
wave-e. Thee-wave tends to be 161.8% of wave-a. If thee-wave is really explosive, it might
relate by 261.8% to wave-a.
b. Irregular
An Irregular Expanding Triangle is the most common Expanding Triangle variation. It is differentiated by wave-b "failing" to move beyond the end of wave-a. If the b-wave fails, waves-a & e will likely
relate by 161.8%.
c.Running
This is the second most likely type of Expanding Limiting Triangle. It is characterized by wave-d
"failing" to exceed the termination of wave-c. If the d-wave "fails," the pattern will have a slightly
skewed upward or downward appearance; also, waves-a & e will probably relate by 261.8%.
[For diagrams of all the above Expanding Trio11gles, see Chapter 5, page 32.]
II. Non-Limiting
Non-Limiting Expanding Triangles should basically follow the same variational parameters
of the Limiting Expanding Triangle. There are only a few differences which need to be covered:
1. The chances are good in a Non-Limiting Triangle that no Fibonacci relationships will be present
between the various segments. If there is a relationship, it will probably be between wave,.a &
e. Wave-e ~ould be 261.8% of wave-a.
2. The apex point of the Expanding Non-Limiting Triangle (which occurs backwards in time and
can only be detected after the Triangle is complete) should be much closer to the start of the NonLimiting than of the Limiting Triangle. Listed below are the calculations that need to be
preformed to test for Non-Limiting status:
a. Measure the entire time duration of the Expanding Triangle from the beginning of wave-a to
the end of wave-e. · Calculate 20% of that amount
b. Add that time amount to the a-wave (going backward in time). If the apex point falls within
that time zone (between 20% and the start of wave-a), the Triangle is Non-Limiting.

The importance of Channeling in the decision process is grossly misunderstood or ignored by the
majority. It seems that most analysts pay little or no attention to Channeling or treat it as if it were a minor
tool of the Wave Theory. Channeling ranks among the top, essential considerations of pattern
formation. Frequently, from a Channeling standpoint alone, it is possible to decide whether a move is
Impulsive or Corrective. It is critical in the confirmation of when a move is finished or is about to finish.
It is extremely helpful in deciding what type of pattern the market is forming and which segment of an
Impulse pattern is likely to be the Extended wave. It is essential in the detection of the end of wave-2
and wave-4. Proper use of Channeling can virtually guarantee when the market is creating a Terminal
Impulse wave, sometimes well in advance. It can provide reliable clues to when the market is
experiencing Triangular activity. From the other side; ffiarket action t:ltil dictate when an assumed 2-4
or 0-B trendline is real, thus helping to substantiate your interpretations. In Chapter 5, "Central
Considerations," some Channeling ideas were covered for waves-2 & 4 of an Impulse pattern. When
Channeling an Impulse wave there are additional considerations, those will now be discussed.
Wave-2
If you have detected an Impulsive polywave (or higher) and feel it might be wave-I of a larger
Impulse pattern, the following Channeling rules can be employed (in Figure 12-1, we are assuming that
wave-I is trending upward). After the market has formed a corrective polywave in the opposite direction
of wave-I and has turned back up (Figure 12-1, diagram A), draw a line .fmm point "O" ~ the lowest
point of the downmove which is assumed to be wave-2 (diagram B). As long as the "0-2" trendline is
not broken, you can assume wave-2 is over and that it completed right at the point the trendline touched
the decline.

"O"
If the trendline is broken before the supposed
3rd-wave is at least 61.8% of wave-1, or the
second decline breaks back below the top of wave1 at the same time the trendline is broken, then you
can be confident wave-2 is still in progress (Diagram C). Why? If an advance, which is moving
away from wave-2, does not have the strength to
stay above the "original" 0-2 trendline, then it is
not Impulsive in nature and cannot be part of
Impulse wave-3. Once wave-3 is complete, it is allowable for the 4th-wave to break the 0-2
trendline, but not necessary. All previous discussions on proper Impulse wave formation must also
be adhered to.

After the fact. a Running Double Three does not significantly affect the overall interpretation of an
Impulse pattem .. l)urin&.their formation,if you doc119tJ!nd~n;tand th~ importance pfchanneling, you may
miss the big move which takes place after a Running Double Three concludes. A Running Double Three
is not a difficult pattern to detect. The problem appears to be that most people think Running Corrections
do not happen very often. In my experience, Running corrections happen quite often (in Impulsions) and
are distinctly different from the (1)-(2), 1-2, i-ii, etc., series for which they are frequently mistaken;
channeling is the key to recognizing these Complex formations.
Using the same idea presented in the "wave-2,,section, no part of wave-3 should break a 11:1K 0-2
·u-endl1ne.-If.the0
advance, after what you think is wave-2, is followed by a corrective phase which breaks
the 0-2 trendline and the advance was not substantial enough to be wave-3, or the advance is actually a
corrective rally, the market is experiencing a Running Double Three (see Figure 12-2).
Another important reason this could not be interpreted as a 1,2,3,4, with the 5th to follow is the lack
of Alternation between the assumed 2nd and 4th-wave.

Figure 12-2
Wave-4
The illustrations in Figure 12-3 depict the best known type of Elliott trendline, the 2-4 trendline.
Similar in concept to the 0-2 trendline, no part of wave-3 or wave-5 should break the 2-4 trendline (see
diagram A) unless the 5th-wave is a Terminal pattern.
Once the 5th-wave is complete, the market should immediately (within the time-period consumed
by wave-5 or less) break the 2-4 trendline and retrace mosr.or all ofwave-5. Diagram B illustrates what
that would look like. If the market does not meet these requirements, the 2-4 trendline is drawn
incorrectly (meaning wave-2 and/or wave-4 are not in the position you assumed) or the 5th is developing
into a Terminal pattern (see Diagram C).
If the assumed 2-4 trendline is broken before the market exceeds the end of wave-3, and a violent
reaction does not immediately and significantly move the market away from the end of the last move,
the 4th-wave is stillde'leloping (see illustration 12-4, Diagram A). Ifthe2-4 trendlineis violently broken
before wave-3 's terminus is exceeded, then a 5th-wave failure is indicated (see Diagram B ). F~r the 5th
wave Failure to be proven, the entire Impulse pattern must be completely retraced faster than 1t took to
form. Afterward, the market can drift awhile or continue on its course, away from the 5th wave failure.
To exceed the end of the 5th-wave Failure the market would need to consume at least twice the time taken
by the entire Impulse pattern (1-5); usually, much more time is be required before a new high (or low
in a downtrend) takes place .

Wave-B
The end of Wave-bis found in a similar fashion to wave-2, with the small difference that the Impulse
wave following wave-b (i.e., wave-c) will hardly ever be more than 161.8% of wave-a and the b-wave
can sometimes be a Triangle. To better understand this concept, look study Figure 12-5.
If wave-b is a Triangle, there are two ways in which the pattern will channel. In Diagram A, the "OB" trendline is actually drawn across the c-wave of the Triangle, not thee-wave. To draw the trendline
across wave-e would create a break of the trendline by wave-c, an unacceptable situation.
Frequently, if wave-bis a Triangle, after the "0-B' trendline has been drawn across the c-wave of the
Triangle, thee-wave will temporarily break that trendline and then reverse (Diagram B). This creates
what Elliott called a "false" break. This "false" break should be very short-lived (relatively speaking)
and the e-wave must not exceed the end of waye-c of the Triangle. After this "false" break, you may
redraw the trendline, but it is not necessary. The larger (c)-wave will not break the 0-B trendline until
it is complete (unless the c-wave becomes a Terminal pattern) .
.. '1)·i"1ngular Activity
Through multiple observations, it is often possible to realize that a Triangle in forming even during
its early stages of development, sometimes Triangles are evident almost immediately after wave-a
completes. A few of these observations have already been discussed. In the paragraphs to follow,
additional techniques to anticipate triangular formations will be covered.
Let us assume the market is in a Zigzag rally and you have drawn what you believe to be a 0-B
trendline (Figure 12-6). The market starts to advance, but then turns down and breaks the trendline before
the minimum price and time requirements forwave-c have been met. If the breakdown does not exceed
the end of the last touch point of the trendline (in this case, what you thought was the end ofwaveb) and the market turns around again, this indicates triangular development (Figure 12-7). If the
market creates a second 'false' break, a Triangle is virtually guaranteed (Figure 12-8).
The patterns in a Triangle frequently act as ifrelevant, market-created trendlines were non-existent.
The corrections within the Triangle break these "trendlines" with the most non-violent, casualness
12-6 Advanced Neely Extensions
(Figure. 12-9). This is another important 'early warning signal' of triangular development. A casual,
meandering break of an established trendline does not assure a b-wave triangle is forming, but it does
virtually guarantee that some type of Triangle of one degree or another is taking place.

sign of triangular formation.
* Points the market price action
created which "made" the trendline.
When using trendlines, the detection of Terminal Impulse activity is very similar to that used in the
detection of Triangular behavior. Figure 12-10, Diagram A, shows what usually happens when a
Terminal is forming. Observe the break of the 2-4 trendline and notice how the market reacted to it. That
is a perfect example of a "non-eventful" trendline break. Notice in this example which wave subdivided,
not wave-(3), the extension, but wave-(5) which was the Terminal pattern. This is an example of the
Independence (see Rule page 9-7) of the Subdivision Rule from the Extension Rule. The Extended
(3)rd-wave is marked with an "x"; the subdivided (5)th-wave is marked with an "s."
During the formation of a Terminal pattern, part of it will usually break the larger 2-4 trendline. To
get only the structure of a Terminal pattern without the early warning of a temporary 2-4 break is rare,
but not impossible (see Figure B, 12-10).
Important: The Wave Theory does allow you to speculate when a particular formation ( trend) has
completed, but the necessary reaction to that formation is quintessential in the verification of your
assumptions. In Figure 12-10, the,~ction after~~l!\_'.e,{~}l!}us~r_!!tum to the low of wave-(4) to confirm
the analysis; if that does not happen, the interpretation is wrong. Note: In Figure 12-10, wave-(4) is the
minimum target for the drop, 99% of the time it would return to the beginning of wave-(1) or lower.
Real 2-4 Trendline
When the 5th-wave ofan Imp~.lse pattern has complet~d, a correctly .drawn 2-4 trendline must be
broken shortly afterward. "Shortly" is a market defined relative tefin: To ascertain what relative means
to a wave pattern you need to check the time consumed by the 5th wave. If the break from the termination
of the 5th wave to the 2-4 trendline takes an equal amount of time !lI.m than that consumed by wave5, the break adheres to normal behavior thereby confirming wave-5's conclusion. If the break takes more
time than wave-5, you must assume wave-5 is developing into a Terminal pattern or the 2-4 trendline
is incorrectly drawn and wave-4 is not finished. Maybe your entire interpretation is incorrect. Whatever
the circumstances, the market has not completed an Impulse sequence (Figure 12-11 ).

With an understanding of the different ways the various Impulse patterns channel, you can frequently
use Channeling to decipher which wave of the pattern is going to be the Extension. The earlier you decide
which wave is the Extension the better you can trade the trend. The explanations and illustrations to
follow will provide you with a clear idea of how each Impulse variation Channels and behaves.
1st Wave Extension
When the first wave Extends in a sequence, the channeling of the pattern should resemble the
channeling of a Terminal move (Figure 12-12). The 5th wave should not touch the upper trendline. It
will usually stay below it, but on occasion, if wave-2 is very larire, it might exceed the upper trendline.
3rd Wave Extension
There are several ways a move with a 3rd wave Extension will channel. No matter which touch points
are used to draw the trendlines, they should always be paralkl ornearparallel (I ip1re 12-13). Notice,
in the diagrams, which of the two corrective phases was more complex (wave-2 or wave-4 ). Drawn are
the typical setups for each 3rd Extension Impulse variation.
5th Wave Extension
There is really only one way to channel a 5th-wave Extension (see Figure 12-14). It is basically the
reverse of a 1st wave Extension. The Channeling will tend to expand outward like a "megaphone."
Double Extension
Even though I am uncomfortable with this pattern, due to its extreme infrequency, it is included here
for completeness. From experience, this is how a Double Extension should channel (see Figure 12-15).

Flats
To detect which Flat variation is unfolding on you chart, all channel lines need to be parallel and
Jwrizontal with the high and low of wave-a the beginning points. In Figure 12-16a (page 12-13), all Flat
patterns have been marked in this fashion. You should study them to understand how the Channeling
of the Correction tells you in advance which type of Flat variation is unfolding.
For sul1J)Ort and resistance levels in a Flat, the Channel lines should be drawn differently. Draw the
Flats' trendline across the beginnini; of wave-a and the kfil!. of wave-b, Figure 12-16b (page 12-14). A

In a Double Extension, the 5th
wave will normally break above

called a Double Extension is that
the 3rd wave is more than 161.8%
of wave-I and the 5th wave is more
than 161.8% of wave-3.

parallel line should be drawn across the end of wave-a to get an idea of the potential support area for wavec. Even if the b-wave of the Flat makes a substantial move beyond the end of wave-a (see Running
Correction in Figure 16-b ), you still draw the trendline based on the above rules. Four of the Diagrams
from Figure 12-16a have been reproduced below in Figure 12-16b to show how real-time channeling
would be administered to the following Flat variations.
Implications of Channeling Flats
The way a Flat channels provides you with subtle clues on the immediate strength or weakness of
the market and gives you an idea of how much the market should advance or decline after the correction
is over. Most of the clues which can be derived from channeling a correction are dependent on the length
of wave-b in relation to wave-a. The larger the b-wave the greater the chances of an explosive move
( either up or down) after wave-c completes. The smaller wave-bis in relation to wave-a, the more likely
the Flat will either be the first segment of a larger a-b-c or the Flat will be followed by an x-wave and
another Standard correction. If~ Flat channeb perfectly (i.e., if wave-c is the same length as wave-a)
it will probably be followed by an x-wave and become part of a Complex Correction (see Irregular
Failure, Figure 12-16c). Figure 12-16c illustrates the imp 1•, ,1tions of various channeling conditions
when working with Flats.

Zigzags
There are not many Zigzag varieties, but there are three distinct ways a Zigzag can Channel (see
Figure 12-17). Diagrams' A & B show "normal" Zigzag channeling. Eitherone of the Zigzags in diagram
A or B could complete a corrective phase. If the Zigzag channels as in Diagram C, the probabilities highly
favor the Zigzag~ conclude the downward correction. It will be part of a complex Double or Triple
pattern. If the Zigzag channels as in Diagram C, the wave which immediately follows should not retrace
all of the Zigzag. If that wave retraces less than 61.8% of the Zigzag, it should be labeled an X-wave.
The x-wave will separate two Standard Elliott corrections.

Triangles
Triangles have a base trendline just as Impulse waves do. The base line for a Tri~gle ~s the B-D
trendline. It should always be employed no matter which Triangle variation you are working with. _When
the trendline gets broken you know the Triangle is over. The trendline on the oth~r side of the T?angle
may be drawn three different ways. The most common is the A-C tre~dline (see F1gu~ 12-1 ~• Diagram

Complex Patterns
All the Channeling rules I have developed over the years and the clues which they provide are more
reliable in "standard" Elliott patterns. When the market unfolds in a more complex, Non-Standard
manner, specific rules are harder to define, but the following I have found to be reliable. Generally, the
base trendline will run across only the "O'' point and the x-wave(s) or the b-waves of the pattern. If the
b-waves consume more time than the x-wave(s), the channel will be drawn using the b-waves. If the xwave(s) is the largest corrective phase, the trendline should be drawn from point "O" across the first xwave. Below is a list of rules for each category of Complex Correction.
Double &Triple Zigzags
The Double or Triple Zigzag, unlike any other Elliott pattern, can provide an ideal channeling
environment. Two parallel lines should contain the entire series of multiple advances and declines
(Figure 12-19 ). This is one of the significant differences between Impulse formations and Double &
Triple Zigzags (which are frequently mistaken as Impulse patterns).

Double & Triple Combinations (which start with Zigzags)
Like Double and Triple Zigzags, usually Double and Triple Combinations will channel within well
defined parallel lines, until the .!llfil corrective phase is nearing completion. Mentioned earlier, most
Double and Triple Combinations conclude with a Triangle. As you know from previous discussions,
Triangles create problems with Channeling. Therefore, the last few segments of the Triangle, which will
conclude the last corrective phase of the Double or Triple Combination, will provide at least one (if not
twoormore) 'false' breaksofthebaseparallellinebeforefinallycompleting. SeeFigure 12-20 forsome

Double &Triple Flats
The x-waves in Double or Triple Flat are almost always much smaller than the a-b-c's which they
separate, so the Channeling has to be executed using the b-waves of each Flat (see Figure 12-21). When
the baseline is broken (if drawn correctly), the pattern should be over. ~: AC-Failure pattern is a
likely candidate for the last Flat of one of these complex formations.

Because there are many variational possibilities with such patterns, it is difficult to create any
Channeling process which will work for all possibilities. The baseline, composed of b-wave termination
points, will always be more reliable than the trendline composed of a-wave termination points. The best
approach is to continue using the b-wave's baseline as the important channel and realize that a-wave
termination points may not create a very clean trendline. In Diagram A of Figure 12-22, the trendline
is satisfactory, but in Diagram Bit does not perform its function as well.

Identifying the Completion of Waves
When you are having difficulty deciding where each Elliott pattern is beginning or ending, the use
of diagonal channel lines will help you identify exposed points which can usually be used to formulate
reliable Elliot Wave counts. Figure 12-24 gives you an idea of how this technique is implemented.
Figure 12-24
Exposed points are best identified with the use of slanting
parallel (or near parallel) channel lines. These channel lines
should encase all market activity of the time period you wish to
srudy. Furthermore, the channel
lines must connect at least two
market-created highs or lows
which fall farthest to the right or
left of the slanting channel line.
In the diagram, numerous 0
exposed points" are identified
along with some guesses of
which Progress labels may be
present at each juncture [note:
the highest price has been confirmed as the end of a previous
Elliott pattern].
I
This is the first low
( which falls along the
channel line) since the
last pattern terminated,
therefore wave-1 or
wave-a must be finishing
at this low. With the decline from the high composed of three parts,
wave-a is the best choice.
This being the first high since the first
important low, it must be wave-b,

There are two major categories of Fibonacci relationships. The first, and most common, I have
termed IQternal relationships. Internal relationships are frequently found in standard Elliott patterns.
External, the other way the market creates Fibonacci relationships, are common in unusual patterns:
Non-Standard Complex Corrective and Terminal or Failure patterns. Each type is covered below, with
examples, and the places they most regularly occur.
Internal
Internal relationships are characterized by the comparison of the price length of one wave to another
with no concern over the price level each wave began or ended (see Figure 12-25). These price ranges
will usually partially overlap. This means part of one move will be in the same price level zone as the
other. Relationships in ~ patterns, with a few exceptions, are almost exclusively Internal.
Depending on the circumstances, relationships in corrections can fall into both camps. Below is a
complete listing of the most common (and some of the less common) ways Internal relationships occur
in Impulse patterns.

Impulse patterns
1st Wave Extension
When wave-I is the longest wave in a pattern, wave-3 should not be more than 61.8% of wave-I.
When wave-3 is 61.8% of wave-I, wave-5 (applying the rule of Alternation) will usually be 38.2% of
wave-3. Ifwave-3 is 38.2% ofwave-1, then wave-5 will usually be 61.8% ofwave-3. Thatis basically
all the Internal relationships possible in a 1st wave Extension (see Figure 12-26).
3rd Wave Extension
When the 3rd wave extends in a pattern, wave-I must not relate to wave-3 Internally by 61.8%. It
could be 38.2% of wave-3, but frequently they will notrelatelntemally at all (study Figure 12-27). When
. ~tbe 3rc:twave is the longest, w.ave.~.1 and wave-5 should be nearly equal (100%) in price or related by
61.8% or 38.2% (ordered from the most to least common relationship). If wave-4 is the complex
correction, the 5th-wave should be equal to or greater than wave-I. If wave-2 is the complex correction,
wave-5 should be equal toor less than wave-I. If wave-I is extremely small in relation to wave-3, the
5th wave will be 38.2% of the entire distance traveled from the beginning ofwave-1 to the topofwave3 added to the end of wave-4 (refer to Figure 12-27). The 5th wave must be less than 61.8% of wave3 if wave-3 is the Extension.

The only possible Internal relationship between wave-1 and wave-3, when the 5th wave extends,
is that wave-3 will be 161.8% of wave-1. If they do not relate, wave-3 must be more than 100%, but less
than 261.8% ofwave-1. If the 5th wave Extension Internally relates to 1 & 3, it will usually be 161.8%
of the distance from "the beginning of wave-1 to the end of wave-3" added to the end of wave-4 (see
Figure 12-28). Wave-5 should be at least 100% of 1+3 or 161.8% of wave-3, whicheveris shoner. It
can be as much as 261.8% of 1+3, but that is about the maximum limit for the length of a 5th-wave
extension (refer to Figure 12-28).
Remember, all discussions above are in reference to Internal relationship possibilities. There are
other ways that wave-I, 3, and 5 can relate in Impulse patterns, but those relationships fall under the
External category. It is also possible, under unusual circumstances, for relationships not to occur
between cenain segments of an Impulsive or Corrective pattern.

Co"ectwns
Wave-2 & Wave-4
Ifwave-2 is the largest price correction of the Impulse pattern, the 4th wave will likely be 61.8% of
the price covered by wave-2 (see Figure 12-29, Diagram A). The next choice would be 38.2%. Ifwave4 is the larger price correction in the Impulse pattern, wave-2 should be 61.8%, or less likely, 38.2% of
wave-4 (refer to Figure 12-29, Diagram B).
Wave-a & Wave-b
Unlike waves 2 &4, waves a & b move in opposite directions. Contrary to the prevailing beliefs of
many, Fibonacci relationships are more reliable between patterns traveling in the £l!llil. direction, not
opposite directions. As a result, there are no consistently reliable relationships between waves-a & b.
The relationship between waves a &b is used mostly in deciding the Structure of the a-wave (see
Retracement Rules and Pre-Constructive Rules of Logic, Chapter 3).

25, page 12-23). If the length of wave-c falls outside of the maximum Internal and External limits (see
External: c-wave, Zigzags) of its relation to wave-a, then the Zigzag is Elongated and should be
considered part of a Triangle. It will either be an entire leg of a Triangle or part of a complex pattern which
is an entire leg of a Triangle.
The c-wave could also be equal in length to wave-a, which is very common (Figure 12-30, Diagram
A). Wave-c should not be less than 61.8% of wave-a, Internally. If so, it is probably due to a very small
b-wave Triangle. The Zigzag is probably the entire leg of a Triangle or part of a complex correction which
is the leg of a Triangle, Figure 12-30, Diagram B.
Wave-c (in a Flat)
The c-wave in a Flat should not exceed the a-wave by more than 138.2% (see Figure 12-31). If the
c-wave is more than 138.2% of wave-a, then it falls into the Elongated Flatcategory. The most common
relation between wave-a and wave-c, in Flats, is near equality (refer to Figure 12-32). The next most
likely relationship is 61.8%. This can happen in basically two ways, as ac-failure (Figure 12-33, Diagram
A) or as a b-failure (Diagram B). The minimum Internal relationship allowed between wave-a and
wave-c is 38.2%. This only happens on rare occasions in what I call a 'severe' failure. This can happen
in three general ways. The b-wave retraces most of wave-a (up to, but not exceeding, 100% [ see Diagram
A of Figure 12-34]). The b-wave retraced wave-a in the area of 81 % (Diagram B). The b-wave must
retrace at least 61.8% of wave-a for this 'severe' failure to still be possible (Diagram C). Of the three,
Diagram A is the most common; Diagram B is next in line and Diagram C is very unlikely.

wave-a.

would all be part of wave-b, not the entire correction.

The c-wave of a Triangle usually relates to wave-a by 61.8%, but do not eliminate a Triangle count
just because that parameter is not met (Fig. 12-35). If wave-bis bigger than wave-a, wave-c might be
61.8% of wave-b (Fig. 12-36). Remember, Triangles are probably the most common, flexible, varied,
and annoying of all Elliott patterns. As long as the market experiences an obvious contraction period
composed of five separate segments and there are at least two Fibonacci relationships that occur between
the various segments, you have a likely candidate for a Triangle (see Chapter 5 for additional Rules).
Wave•d
Wave-d only occurs in Triangles. It will normally relate to wave-b by 61.8%. Wave-d could relate
to virtually any wave in the Triangle by 61.8% or 38.2%.
Wave-e
Wave-e will usually relate to wave-d by 61.8% .w: 38.2%. It could also relate to the larger waves by
38.2%. If it relates to wave-a it would probably be because the b-wave were larger than wave-a.
12-28 Advanced Neely Extensions
External
Unlike Internal relationships, External relationships are based on non-overlapping but touching
price ranges. For example, wave-a may be 50 points long and complete at the 500 level. If the c-wave
were to relate Externally to wave-a, you would calculate 61.8%, 100%, and 161.8% values of wave-a
and add or subtract those amounts from the 500 level (Figure 12-37). Here you .illi:..l1Q1 directly relating
the length of wave-a to wave-c; you are measuring wave-a and then subtracting price amounts, based on
the Fibonacci ratios, from wave-a's low which relate only to wave-a. In other words, External relations
are derived by using one price length and taking Fibonacci ratios in increasing or decreasing scale and
adding or subtracting those values directly from a specific price level defined by the termination of one
of the waves of the pattern being studied. These levels would be considered potential support or
resistance zones. If the market stops and reverses at one of these levels it has confirmed their importance.

1st wave Extension
or 1.618
Since wave-3 should not be much more than 61.8% of extended wave-I, there are not many External
relationship possibilities for a 1st wave extension. If you take 61.8% of wave-I in Figure 12-38, and add
that amount to the end of wave-I, you have a resistance level for the next advance. If wave-2 retraced
any of wave-1 (which is mandatory in Multi wave or higher patterns), the 3rd wave would be too long
if it reached that resistance level. The only conclusion is that that is where the entire advance will
terminate (Fig. 12-38). If the 1st wave extension is going to form around External relationships, the
61.8% resistance point is the most common. It is possible the entire advance could terminate 38.2%
above the 1st wave, but it is not likely and would indicate a fairly high level of market weakness (or
strength if the pattern completed downward). A 38.2% External relation would favor that the whole
Impulse pattern terminated a larger formation.
12-30 Advanced Neely Extensions
3rd Wave Extension
There are no reliable External relationships within 3rd wave Extension patterns. Why? The market
turning points are too close or too far away to relate by common Fibonacci ratios (see Figure 12-39).
5th Wave Extension
External relationships are more common than Internal relationships when the 5th wave extends.
There are two situations where External relations can apply in an Extended 5th wave pattern:
(1) First, the 3rd wave can stop at a point that is 161.8% above the end of wave-I (Figure 12-40,
diagram A). That would be the most likely if external relations are involved. The next possibility is 100%
above the end of wave-1 (Figure 12-40, Diagram B). If the 3rd wave exceeds the 161.8% level, it will
likely be the Extended wave and the 5th wave should be shorter than wave-3.
(2) Second, the 5th wave can stop at a point that is 100%, 161.8% or261.8% above the top of wave3 (Figure 12-41 ). The 161.8% level is the most likely level for the termination of the 5th wave Extension.
The 100% level is the next most likely, and the 261.8% level is only likely if the market is terminating
a large, long term advance ( or decline). Note, in Figure 12-41, at each level there is a comment on the
implications of each relationship at that point.

Corrections
Double & Triple Zigmgs and Combinations
Quite often in more complex corrections, after the first External support or resistance level has
produced a reversal, the market may turn around and break through that level. Almost always, the second
push to new price levels will move only 61.8% of the previous break. If there is a third break, it should
move 38.2% of the original move. This is what I call the "waterfall effect" (Figure 12-42).
Frequently, the first Zigzag of the complex pattern will have its own External relationships between
waves-a & c. Afterward, it is necessary to use the entire price value of the first Zigzag as a "yardstick"
for the rest of the support or resistance levels. This "entire" value is marked with an asterisk (*) in the
diagram below and is next to the~ "1.00."
The Waterfall Effect isiby far, most often found in Double Zigzag patterns or complex patterns that
start with a Zigzag. To apply the concept to Triple Zigzags and Combinations, work with two groups
at a time. In other words, work with the first two corrections as if the pattern were only a Double Zigzag.
After completing that study, work with the second two Zigzags in the same way (you will be making use
of the middle correction twice). All the same rules should apply as the ones discussed for Figure 12-42.

When available data creates price action which falls somewhere between the monowave and
polywave stage of development, an event never before discussed in Elliott literature comes into play,
"Missing Waves." This phenomenon, when not understood, can wreak havoc with your short-term
assessment of a market's possibilities. When a wave is "missing" it is always a monowave, it is never
a polywave or higher pattern. Fortunately, even when a wave is missing from your data, it can be detected
indirectly based on the illogical integration of pattern implications and based on the strange development
of price behavior inherent with "missing" waves.
12-34 Advanced Neely Extensions
Where and when do they occur?
Missing waves occur m on a polywave scale, not multiwave or higher. They are possible in
Impulsive polywaves, but are more common in Non-Standard complex, corrective polywaves. Standard
Elliott corrections cannot contain "Missing Waves." Waves will occasionally be missing in a formation
when the market is preparing to make a significant change in trend.
How do they occur?
All Elliott patterns require a minimum number of monowaves to be correctly formed. An Impulse
wave cannot be formed with only fourmonowaves, it must contain at least five (5). A correction requires
at least three (3) monowa:ves. As should be clear, to make a specific number of monowaves requires a
certain number of data points. When such things as Alternation, Time relationships, Rule of Equality,
etc., are considered, it is possible to calculate the number of data points necessary to create a minimally
acceptable Elliott polywave pattern.
Below is a listing of the minimum number of data points needed for a pattern to have the chance of
fully developing without a missing wave. Possessing the minimum number of data points does not
eliminate the possibility of a missing wave in the pattern, it only decreases the likelihood. Having less
than the needed number of data points guarantees there exists a missing wave in the pattern (as long as
your progress label interpretations are correct). A polywave with twice the minimum number of data
points required (or more) should not be considered a candidate for a missing wave. Each one of the
listings below includes the starting data point as part of the minimum required to form the pattern liste<l
(Figure 12-45).

Advanced Neely Extensions 12-35
For a pattern to contain a missing wave, it must talce just the right number of data points to form most,
but not all, of the monowaves needed. What is "just the right number''? It is not a specific amount, but
a range. Fifty percent of the minimum amount required for a formation ( or less) basically eliminates the
possibility of a missing wave and so does a~ of the minimum amount. Why? At half the
minimum, the pattern would be so simple it would on register as a monowave QI a simpler corrective
pattern. [For example, Double Zigzags will appear as single Zigzags when severe time restraints are
placed on their formation; see Figure 12-46] At twice the minimum level, there would be too much detail
to allow for a missing wave.
From this it becomes clear that the range of data points which allows for a missing wave is half of
the minimum plus one (+I) or twice the minimum minus one (-1 ). Any numberof data points below the
minimum (but higher than halfway) indicates a missing wave is a certainty or that your wave count is
incorrect. For each additional data point above the minimum, the chances increase geometrically that
a missing wave will not be present. Once the number of data points reaches twice tlie minimum level
a missing wave should be considered impossible.

Zigzag
12-36 Advanced Neely Extensions
In Diagram A, there are 9 data points which make
up a Double Zigzag (the 10th data point confinns
the conclusion of the Double Zigzag). If the time
element available for the formation of this move
were only lllllf: the currently allotted 10 time units,
the Double Zigzag would look like a single Zigzag
(see Diagram B).
Working with the same data as in Diagram A, but only
plotting every other point, you can clearly see how the
detail of a pattern decreases and simplifies. This reduction in the number of data points distorts what actually
took place in the market, making the aetionJookJike a
simple Zigzag instead of a Complex Correction. Fortunately, such a severe reduction in the number of data
points generally produces a !li.ffmnt, but still identifiable, Elliott pattern. It is when the available data falls
somewhere between the two diagrams that a missing
wave becomes reality. Even when a wave is missing, it
still can be detected due to the strange behavior it creates.
Why do they occur?
Now that you know how they occur, the question comes up, "Why would a market not have enough
data points to create an Elliott pattern?" All analytical studies must be done within certain limitations.
When you want to do some analysis, you have to decide which market to observe, you have to decide
when to start you chart, what period of time the chart will cover and what type of data will be used. Will
it be yearly data (which may be appropriate for real estate, farming or interest rates). Maybe the study
requires shorter-term information such as weekly or daily (which is more appropriate for stock and
commodity analysis). No matter what your decision, it will create limits; eitheron the amount of market
action visible for analysis or on YQYr time to analyze.
Whatever period of time you choose to monitor, there is usually shorter-term price data available
which would revc al further intricacies of price action. When a pattern on a shorter-term chart completes,
there may or may not be enough data points on the next larger chart for the same (but less detailed) pattern
to fully develop. When the complexity of a short-term move exceeds the number of data points (time
units) available to form the same pattern on a longer term chart, a simvlified version of the same move,
a monowave or a "missing wave" is unavoidable. An example of a simplified version is a complex pattern
turning into a simple pattern (a Double Zigzag into a single Zigzag, see Figure 12-46). Or, if there is too
much time disparity between one chart and the next, then the complex pattern on the short-term chart will
appear as a monowave on the longer term chart. If the time difference between charts is small, a "missing
wave" is virtually inevitable.
For our theoretical example, we have chosen the London Gold am/pm fixes for our "longer-term"
data and the continuously traded International Gold Market as our shorter-term data. The London Fixes
( the best way to follow Gold, in my opinion) will provide us with two average Gold prices per day. The
international Cash market will allow us to monitor the formation of super short-term Elliott patterns.
In Figure 12-47, there are two plots. One is of the am/pm Gold Fix, the other of intraday cash Gold
market data. The light line is the IGM over several days. The dot in the middle of each day and at the
end of ea<;h day represents the time when the London Fix was released. The dark line is the London Gold
fixes plotted separately and each connected with a straight line. As you can plainly see, the IGM reveals
an Impulse pattern over the three-day period. The London data displays a pattern which resembles a near
perfect Zigzag; that is how a "missing wave" can occur.
The London Gold plot would force you to assume the market is ready to decline since it appears to
be correcting upward .. The market action which follows the "Zigzag" will prove that interpretation
wrong. If you study the "Emulation" section (page 12-38), you should be able, at least in hindsight, to
correctly reconstruct the "Zigzag" into a bullish pattern.
Which patterns are susceptible?
The most susceptible patterns to missing waves are Complex Corrective Polywaves ( corrections that
involve x-waves). Virtually without exceptions, it is the x-wave which is "missing" in one of these
patterns (see "emulation" for a more detailed description). This is due to the fact that x-waves are almost
always the smallest corrective waves of such patterns, so they are the first to disappear as the time element
of the Correction is reduced. Much less frequently, Impulsive polywave patterns which have a 1st or 5th
wave Extension can "miss" their smaller corrective phase. In a 5th wave Extension that would be wave2 (as in Figure 12-47). In a 1st wave Extension it would be wave-4.

Emulation is a tough area. This phenomenon occurs when one pattern (Corrective or Impulsive) is
mimicking the behavior of a pattern from the~ Cla~. This obviously can create problems with
the analysis process. The two redeeming aspects of this transgression is that it occurs only on short-term
price action of polywave development and almost always provides the astute analyst forewarning clues.
In the early stages of market development, the transition from monowaves to polywaves is, on
occasion, unstable. It is one of the few, truly tricky periods you must learn to deal with. When one pattern
Emulates another, it generally indicates the pattern is ''missing a wave.".Y ou will ha'\'e t~ ascertain when
the market.!£ or is not revealing all ofits behaviorto you. The phrase, "missing wave," is used to describe
unseen market action. It is imperative you understand the missing wave concept before continuing with
this section (see "Missing Waves," page 12-34).
Below are numerous patterns that, to the casual observer, would appear to be another Elliott pattern.
Despite the missing waves which might occur in these patterns, they still have their own recognizable
shape and behavior.

Double Failure
Unlike most other "emulations," the Double Failure can only fool you during its formation and for
a short time period of time after it is complete. Many of the other "emulations" can keep you off track
fo~ some time .lJ.ll!w rou ~ closely watching market action. As you can see in Figure 12-48, the Double
Failure can temporanly mtslead you into the assumption that a Triangle is forming. When the supposed

forming a Triangle. A .Ys:o'. minor clue that this pattern is taking place during it formation would come
from the application of Fibonacci relationships. In a Triangle, the a & c wave usually relate by 61.8%,
Internally. In a Double Failure, the c-wave will usually fall at a specific price level important to wavea from an External standpoint (Figure 12-49).

Double Flats
This pattern, if missing the x-wave, could easily be mistaken for an Impulse wave with a 3rd wave
extension (see Figure 12-50, Diagram A). On short-term patterns, it is very possible the x-wave will be
"missed" since x-waves are usually the smallest corrections in a pattern. There are three major clues the
pattern is actually corrective.
First, the supposed 2nd wave (Figure l2-50A) retraced more than 61.8% of wave-1, which indicates
wave-1 is more likely corrective (:3) than Impulsive (:5). [Caveat: it is acceptable for J1JJ!1of wave-2
to retrace more than 61 .8% of wave-I, but it is not acceptable for wave-2 to terminate beyond the 61 .8%
level, which it did in the diagram.]
Second, there is !lQ alternation in time, price or structure between waves 2 & 4 in Figure 12-50A. If
there is not alternation of any sort between waves 2 & 4, it does not matter what the pattern looks like;
the move is not Impulsive.
Third, attention to Fibonacci relationships could indicate the presumed "3rd extension" is only
161.8% or less of the presumed 1st wave. This, of course, tells you "wave-3" is nQ1 the extension and
tl}e assumed 5th wave should have been much larger.
If you witness a situation like the one shown in Figure 12-50A (and described above), divide the
longest wave (the one that looks like wave-3) in half and assume the halfway point is where a "missing"
x-wave occurred (Figure 12-50B). After the pattern terminates, it should be compacted to a ":3."
Double & Triple Zigzags
The major difference between the Double Flat and the Double Zigzag is wave-b in the first Zigzag
will not retrace more than 61.8% of wave-a. From an Emulation standpoint, this makes the Double Flat
(missing the x-wave) easier to detect since true 2nd-waves should not terminate at a point that is more
than a 61.8% retracement of wave-I. Similar to the Double Flat, the lack of alternation between the
assumed waves 2 & 4 would still be present and may be the .Qilb! early warning the move is actually
corrective. Attention to Fibonacci relationships may provide a clue if the presumed "3rd extension" is
only 161.8% or less of the presumed 1st wave. This should not happen in areal Impulse pattern unless
the 5th wave extends; from the diagram, that is clearly not the case. The next clue will not come until
much later when the market retraces the Double Zigzag by more than 61.8% (implying the presumed
"Impulse" pattern is actually Corrective).
To the inexperienced Elliottician, the Triple Zigzag or Combination pattern will look like an Impulse
patte~. Triple Zigzags, with missing x-waves, would not generally be a problem since Triples "emulate"
Double Zigzags (Figure 12-52C). Double and Triple Zigzags have nearly the same implications, so misinterpreting one as the other would not make much difference to the larger trend.
The following are reasons why Figure 12-52A does not make a dependable Impulse pattern:
1. A Triple Zigzag or Combinal!<?I!:Willusually_channelfar too well to~ ccmsidered an Impulse
pattern (see "Channeling" - Impulse waves). When a move channels like 12-52A, that is about
as good a signal of complex corrective behavior as you can get.
2. The declining waves are too similar in price and time coverage leaving the market without an
Extended wave, which is mandatory for Impulsive activity.
3. The action after the presumed 5th wave did not break the 2-4 trendline soon enough (see 2-4
Trendline).
4. Both waves 2 & 4 indicate weakness, breaking the rule of alternation.
12-40 Advanced Neely Extensions
It would truly be a dereliction of an analyst's duties to misinterpret a Triple Zigzag which is not
missing any x-waves (Fig. 12-53). The problem with the proposed.count should be obvious; waves-3
& 5 are clearly Zigzag patterns, not Impulsions. That type of development for the odd numbered sections
of an Impulse wave is impossible unless the market is forrnin a Terminal pattern. Due to the Channeling
of the move (see Channeling - Terminal patterns), this is without a doubt, not a Terminal pattern.

1st Wave Extension
When a wave is missing from an Impulse pattern, the resultant price action will almost always look
like a Zigzag correction. This makes Impulsions the hardest to detect, especially before they are
complete.
When the first wave extends, the 2-wave should almost always be the most complex and timeconsuming pattern. Over short periods of time, when the numberof data points comprising the polywave
is in the~ of"missing wave" susceptibility, the 4th wave may not be visible, creating what looks like
a Zigzag with a c-wave equal tom: shorterthan wave-a (Figure 12-54). It cannot be proven this pattern
is missing a wave until after it is completed.
5th Wave Extension
When the wave extends, the 2nd wave, being the smallest correction, will be the first pattern to
disappear during a contraction of the time element. A 5th wave extension with a missing 2nd wave will
look like a Zigzag with a c-wave which is equal to~ than wave-a (Figure 12-55).

This is a completely new conceptual discovery by the author which, for the first time, helps you
overcome the problem of alternate counts. When you are working with price action, there are time
periods when the Elliott pattern forming is clear and no reliable alternatives to the interpretation exist.
At other times, numerous possibilities exist which can leave many analysts in a quandary.
As remarkable as it may sound, this state of confusion can be exploited to aid you in deciphering the
market's position; if not specifically, at least generally. This involves a process I call "Reverse Logic."

Plainly, the rule states: When more than one, perfectly acceptable wave interpretation is possible
from the SWJt.data series, the market must be near the center of a Corrective or Impulsive pattern.
The more possibilities that exist the closer the market is to the center of a large Elliott formation
(wave-b of wave-b; wave-3 of wave-3 or wave-x of a Non-Standard Complex Correction).
How can the Reverse Logic Rule be used to advantage? Whenever the market reaches a point in
which careful study reveals numerous possibilities, you should automatically assume the market is
toward the middle of a pattern. This knowledge will allow you to eliminate all alternate interpretations
which indicate a pattern is about to complete. If you keep only the interpretations which indicate the
market is in wave-b, wave-3 or wave-x (the middle section of each type of Elliott pattern), usually only
one interpretation will remain.
This rule has additional significance and use in trading. If you are waiting to enter a market, but there
are numerous interpretations possible, do not trade until the possibilities decrease to only one.
Obviously, if there are too many possibilities the market is halfway through its move. Entering at that
time would mean more risk and less potential. The only way to take advantage of such a situation is to
work with a trend following technique until the count starts to become clear and the possibilities diminish
to only one. Another beneficial aspect of this Rule occurs when you are already positioned in a market.
If you entered the market when only one logical interpretation of the wave pattern is possible and you
are currently in profit, do not be scared out when the number of interpretation possibilities increases. That
is just a sign that the market has a lot further to go before it can top or bottom out.
Localized Progress Label Changes
llll~llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I I I I I I I I I I I I
If you have been following a market and successfully calling its turning points for awhile, then
suddenly something completely unexpected occurs, that is not reason to completely discard your interpretation. A count which has been accurately revealing the path of future price action must have some
factors which are correct even if those factors are based only on Structure. The most important
consideration when making changes to a count is to make them as minor as possible. If minor changes
do not work, more significant ones will need to be implemented.
Howdoyoumakeminorcountchanges? Thevastmajorityofthetimetheneedforacountadjustment
is due to the expansion of a pattern (refer to Flexibility of Progress Labels). What you thought was the
end of a Correction or Impulse pattern was only wave-a or wave-1 (respectively) of a mon: complex
Correction or Impulse move. This fact provides you with a very simple process of count adjustment.
Starting with the very last monowave on your chart, whatever label that monowave has been assigned,
drop down to the next smaller Degree title. Using that Title, assume the monowave is only wave-a or
wave-1 ( whichever is appropriate for the situation) of a larger Correction or Impulse pattern. The same
principle would work for segments larger than monowave development.
-• •For example; let us say you observe a large Impulse advance which you as~u_me is the end of a bull
market. After correcting, the market makes a new high. The new high indicates the bull market is not
over. What do you do about your previous labeling? The high you had marked as the end of wave-5 (of
any degree) at the top of the bull market, becomes wave-I of the same Degree. The degree Title of wave5 drops down one level. If you had been working with a corrective pattern, what you marked as the end
of the Correction would become a lower degree a-wave of a larger corrective pattern.

MARKET CYCLES
The Future Course of the U.S. Stock Market
An Elliott Wave Viewpoint
by Glenn Neely
THE GROUND WORK: What Does the
Theory Furnish the Technician?
The Elliott Wave Theory furnishes a framework within
which to organize a market's price action into specific
formations over any time period. All market action under
the Wave Theory breaks down into two major categories:
1. Action with the larger trend.
2. Action against the larger trend.
1. Simplistically, price action moving with the trend ( of the
next larger magnitude) will be constructed differently from
that going against the trend. The majority of price movement in the direction of the trend will be constructed of
five smaller phases or segments (see Figure la). Broadly
speaking, this type of price action is defined as Impulsive
(in nature). If a pattern on the largest scale possible is
Impulsive, it cannot be completely retraced until al least
one more comparable Impulse wave (in the same direction
as the first) is completed.
2. Price action that moves iri the opposite direction of thi:
next larger trend is usually constructed of three smaller
segments (see Figure lb). This type of action is classified
as Corrective (in nature). When price action is correctively
constructed, future price action will usually retrace the
Correction completely.
DYNAMIC CONCEPTS
For anyone who has tried, it is usually futile to linearly
extrapolate current market or economic action into the
future. Ask any corporation how well they predicted their

and teaches the only real-time Elliott Wave course in the

own growth and future demand for their products based
on previous years' data. Usually their forecasts
icantly different from the final results.
History demonstrates that man's progress is dynamic and
logarithmic, not static or linear. Look at the historical,
logarithmic chart on the U.S. stock market dating back to
1789 (see Figure 2, courtesy Foundation for the Study of
Cycles). Sometimes advances occur in spurts, followed by
consolidation phases that last for long periods of time.
Then again, occasionally the reverse happens. This reveals
the market's dynamic behavior. The relatively consistent
advance on a log scale for the last 200-plus years demonstrates the logarithmic nature of economic progress.
The Wave Theory supplies the analyst with a forecasting
tool that is best implemented on a logarithmic basis.
Furthermore, it allows for dynamic development contained within a fractal process. Fractals are part of a relatively new and burgeoning area of science called "Chaos."
Chaos deals with the multifarious .character of turbulence
and the complex geometry of propagation in nature. The
association with fractals comes from the Wave Theory's
flexibility within a structured formal. Repetition of Elliott
patterns occurs over and over, each time with a slight
variation or new twist. These repetitive patterns can then
be combined to create larger patterns of appearance or
design similar to the smaller structures. For example, if you
examined Figure la under a microscope, the long center
217
segment would break down into a pattern which might
closely represent the appearance of the entire diagram.
With the introduction of Chaos, science is now able to
explain what has, heretofore, been considered random
behavior. The numerous similarities between the Wave
Theory and Chaos science further validates the applicability of the Wave Theory to the once-thought "random"
action of stock and commodity prices.
PRICE ACTION LIMITATIONS
Elliott Wave price patterns force the analyst into specific
conclusions. The conclusions are not based on emotion or
opinion, but are forced upon the analyst through objective
and detailed study. Predictions are derived from the
highest probability outcome founded on historical precepent. When applied correctly, the Theory can help the
analyst produce short- and long-term forecasts which are,
occasionally, pinpoint accurate.
THE ANALYSIS: Implications of the
Long-Term Data
A quick overview of the long-term price activity (Figure 2)
immediately brings to bear one important fact. The start
of the advance, which has been in progress for at least 200
years, cannot be coincident with the beginning of the curDow

rently available long-term data series. Remember, the
Wave Theory is a natural law of progression. Its reflections
of societal development are present whether someone is
around to register them or not. It is only logical to assume
that the recording of data would not necessarily coincide
with the advent of a multi-century advance.
DETERMINING AN HISTORICAL LOW
FOR THE LONG-TERM DATA SERIES
The data we are working with starts in 1789. Obviously, this
country was inhabited and growing before that time, so
there was economic activity taking place, albeit unrecorded. A quick glance at the start of the data series
reveals that the price action was initially drifting sideways
for several decades. This is not the way a trend (Impulsive
action) begins. The commencement of a trend (under the
Wave Theory) must begin with Impulsive action-action
that is only minimally retraced by later activity. You can
see that the market drifted back and forth many times
before finally advancing in the early 1800s. This implies the
20-plus-year consolidation must have been a Corrective
phase following an Impulse (trending) pattern.
Methodically administering a host of subtle Elliott Wave
techniques, I deduced that the best point of inception for
the last 200-plus year advance was 0.30 (i.e, 30 cents). The
market was most likely at that level around the year 1765
± 10 years. The following observations helped me to arrive
at the above conclusions:

FIGURE 2 © Glenn Neely TIME
218 CYCLES September/October 1988
1. For the last 200-plus years, the U.S. economy (based on
stock market averages) has been advancing at a great clip
( approx. 100,000% since the official projected low around
2.51 in 1789). Based on this evidence, it is safe to assume
that the U.S. stock market has been in a trending pattern
(Impulsion) since that time or before. According to R.N.
Elliott, an Impulse wave should contain an Extension ( one
advance that is significantly longer than the other advances). Since 1789, there has not been an Extended wave
(see Figure 2); the second and third advance are about
equal, and the first advance is much smaller. This is a
pivotal observation. If the nature of the advance since the
1700s is to be considered Impulsive, there must eventually
be one advancing wave that is substantially longer than the
others. Resting solely on that fact, it is imperative to assume
the multi-century economic expansion, probably beginning
with the colonization of North America, has not ended.
2. The large middle section (second advance) of the last
200-year advance (1860 to 1929) is Corrective in nature.
Impulse patterns are known for their acceleration phases.
These usually occur toward the center of the longest wave.
It is immediately evident that the advance from 1860 to the
high in 1929 does not exhibit any such acceleration phase
toward its center. Actually, the reverse is true; the second
advance consolidates toward its center (see Figure 2). This
is basically impossible in an Impulse pattern.
3. From 1940 to 1960, the U.S. experienced the largest,
most persistent, least retraced stock market advance in
Dow- l(n)
recorded history (see Figure 2). If a market starts to
increase its rate of acceleration after prolonged periods of
slower action (relatively speaking), it is an excellent indication that an Extended wave is getting underway. The
strongest argument for an extension beginning in 1949 is
the gradually increasing market volume over the last forty
years as the market continues to make new highs. Volume,
as a rule, increases toward the center of an Extended wave,
especially if that extension is a third wave.
4. A base trend line can aid in the identification of Corrective patterns of the same degree (i.e., patterns within the
same Elliott formation). When employing this technique
on the available data (see Figure 4), the trend line runs
across the low in 1860 and 1932. There is no doubt that a
Flat pattern (with a C-wave failure), starting in 1835,
concluded at the low in 1860. That F1at pattern contained
the typical three segments common to most corrections.
The complexity of the F1at correction is far too great to be
directly relatable to the virtually vertical decline which
started in 1929 and finished in 1932. If the two points
identified by the trend line are to have any relation, the
Corrective period after 1929 must have been more complex
and time consuming than is immediately apparent. During
Elliott's lifetime, he interpreted the price action from 1929
to about 1949 as a 21-yearcontraction phase (a Triangle,
using Elliott's terminology; see Figure 4). Once a 21-year
Triangle is included in the price structure, there is better
time corroboration between the two corrective phases

along the base trendline (i.e., a 25-year Flat Correction
from 1835 to 1860, and a 21-year Triangle).
THE LONG-TERM WAVE COUNT
The previous analysis enabled me to determine that the
historical starting point for the U.S. stock market was most
likely 30 cents in 1765 ( ±10 years)! From this it was
possible to place a long-term wave count on the historical
data series. The results displayed in Figure 3 (p. 219) are:
Wave (I)
Wave (II)
Wave (III)
1765 to 1835
1835 to 1949
1949 to 2020-2060
The following analysis details the placement of the above
wave count:
1. With a starting level of0.30 (around 1765) established,
the advance to 1835 now becomes a very clear Impulse
pattern with a long (extended) first wave (see Figure 4).
The 1835 high would be labeled wave (1) of SuperCycle
degree.
2. It has already been decided that there was a Flat correction from 1835 to 1860, which was part of SuperCycle wave
(II); and that the advance from 1860 to 1929, based on the
highest probabilities, was corrective in nature. If that rally
had been Impulsive, the low in 1860 would have been the
end of wave (II) of SuperCycle degree. Since the advance
is Corrective, the rally from 1860 to 1929 must also be part
of SuperCycle wave (II) ( see Figure 4).
When a second wave contains a Corrective advance of that
magnitude (1860-1929), the second advance must be some
variation of Running Correction. The most common form
of Running Correction is the Double Three. A Double
Three typically concludes with a Non-Limiting Triangle
(Elliott Waves in Motion, pp. 5-30, 10-8). This provides a
perfect explanation for the 21-year Triangle between 1929
and 1949 that Elliott described. That Triangle terminated
a 115-year corrective phase which finalized SuperCycle
wave (II) (beginning in 1835; see Figure 4).
3. Wave-3 started In 1949 and is still unfolding. The
powerful implications of a second-wave Running Correction guarantee that the third wave will be the longest wave
of this multi-century advance. When the third wave is the
longest wave of a pattern, it will generally subdivide more
than wave-1 or wave-5. As this subdivision occurs, a
smaller five-wave move (Impulse pattern) will become
evident within the third wave. Inside this larger third wave,
wave-1 and 2 will usually mimic the price action of the
larger first and second wave. (In this case, the larger first
wave begins approximately 1765, and the second wave ends
in 1949.) Applying this concept, we can anticipate that the
advance from 1949 to some future date will look similar to
the price action from 1765 to 1949 (see Figure 4).

From 1949, an Impulse wave is present that concludes at
the high in 1966. That high is wave-1 of Cycle degree. The
sideward action from 1966 until 1974 would complete a
three-phase Flat correction. It was from the 1974 low that
the latest "bull market" began in stocks. Once again,just
like the period from 1860 to 1929, the 1980s "bull" market
was Corrective in nature (see Figure 5). In addition, all of
the action since the high in 1987 is unfolding into Corrective patterns.
The remarkable parallelism between Supercycle wave (I)
and (II) and the latest Cycle wave-1 and wave-2 (Cycle 2 is
still unfolding) cannot be discarded. These additional
conclusions can be derived from the growing evidence:
1. When measured from the low in 1932 (approximately
55.00), Cycle wave-1 and SuperCycle wave (I) (ending
1835) relate to each other by 61.8% in price and time. This
development is very interesting when it is considered that
the historical prediction for the time and price beginning
of the 200-plus year advance was concluded independently
of this fact.
2. The corrections that follow the larger and the smaller
first waves are both Flat corrections.
3. The two large corrective advances, one from 1860 to
1929 and the other from 1974 to 1987(?), are both Double
Zigzag patterns (see Figure 5). Since the larger advance
Dow
ow - L(n)
from 1860 was a Cycle degree X-wave, it is only logical to
assume that the pattern from 1974 to 1987 would be an
X-wave of Primary degree (one degree lower than Cycle).
As in 1929, the 1987 high is only part of a larger second
wave.
4. Implementing the 61.8% ratio again, this time to the
21-year Triangle, we can assume that a 13-year contraction
started October 1987 (21 x .618).
5. The maximum extent of the correction, which began in
October 1987, is limited to the 1932 percentage retracement of the previous Cycle X-wave (1860-1929). That
retracement value was about 50%. Taking 50% of the
advance from 1974 to 1987, a level of approximately 1640
is indicated on the Dow. Since the low the day after the
1987 crash was 1706 (very close to 1640), there is good
reason to believe that the 1987 crash low is the corollary
to the 1932 bottom. It cannot be ruled out that the crash
low may be exceeded. If so, it should not be broken by
more than about 100 Dow points.
6. Measuring the advance for SuperCycle wave (I), calcu•
lating 61.8%, and adding that amount to the end of SuperCycle wave (I), you arrive at precisely the 1929 top (see
Figure 5). This is a very typical stopping point for an
X-wave in a Double-Three Running Correction. Checking

the fraction .618, and adding that amount to the top of
Cycle 1 puts you exactly at the 1987 high.
The fact that multiple measurements, when applied to
wave segments of one lower degree, produce the same
results is beyond coincidence. There is no doubt that Cycle
wave-1 and wave-2 are, so far, mimicking the action of
SuperCycle waves (I) and (II).
CONCLUSIONS
The inherent power of a 115-year "Running Double-Three
Correction" (SuperCycle wave (II), 1949) has astounding
implications for the future. This allows us to arrive at a
resolution on the most probable market and economic
activity for the next 70 years:
1. The economic contraction which started in October
1987 will be of ONE LOWER magnitude in severity than
the Depression of 1932. Why? The Cycle 2-wave currently
in progress is of one lower degree than the correction in
1932. As the market moves sideward for the next 13 years,
economic conditions should gradually improve as they did
from 1932 to 1949.
2. SuperCycle wave (III) is going to be the Extended wave
of the Impulse pattern (see Figure 6). In other words,
SuperCycle wave (III) will be much longer than SuperDow~ l(n)
Cycle wave (I). This means the U.S. market, right after the
turn of this century, should begin to advance again. This
advance should last for decades, creating the biggest bull
market of all time (see Figure 6). The minimum expectation for an Extended wave is 161.8% of the previous Impulse wave of the same degree. Measuring the length of
SuperCycle wave (I), calculating the above ratio, .and
adding the product to the end of SuperCycle wave (II)
(1949) produces the incredible, minimum target of (you'd
better sit down) over 100,000 basis the Dow. By applying
time techniques to the Wave structure, that price level
should not be achieved any earlier than the year 2020, and
no later than 2060!
FUNDAMENTAL JUSTIFICATION
AND COMMENTS
The seeds are currently being sown for an international
boom of unprecedented proportions. Over the next few
decades, the majority of third world countries should have
become industrialized. This will bring dramatic improvements in the standard of living for all citizens of such
countries. International competition should invoke
jealousy and a "keep up with the Joneses" mentality, forcing such communist countries as Russia to move toward a
more productive, capitalistic economy.
After the year 2000, the world should begin moving into the
most optimistic period ever experienced. This psychology

should be in full swing by the year 2050. Toward the middle
of the next century, there should be a virtual lack of wars,
famines, depression, etc. - a sustained period of prosperity
and peace.
For those of you who find a 100,000 Dow incomprehensible, consider that the market, from my predicted low of
0.30 up to the 1987 high of approximately 2700, has increased in value almost one million percent in a little over
200 years. A move from 2700 to 100,000 is 011/y 4900%.
The analysis allows 70 years for this to take place. Thus, a
move to 100,000 in 70 years is highly plausible in comparison to the historical record.
I realize the conclusions outlined in this article characterize a near utopian society; but remember, all concluCYCLES September/October 1988
sions are based on what the Wave Theory virtually
"guarantees" will be the most incredible economic period
of all time. The latter ( conclusions) is logically derived
from the former (analysis).

Glenn Neely is President and Founder of the
Elliott Wave lnstitute(l 983) located in Laguna Beach,
California. He teaches the only rear.time Elliott
Wave Course in the world (conducted solely over the
telephone) and publishes ''WaveWatch," an Elliott
Wave Correspondence Course, which systemati·
cally describes how to apply Elliott Wave to real-time
market action. Indisputably the premier contempo·
rary innovator in the Elliott Wave arena, many
consider Mr. Neely also to be the most accurate and
knowledgeable Elliottician in the world!
In 1979 Mr. Neely began studying markets and
economics. It was in 1980, while examining a book
entitled "The Commodity Futures Game," !hot he first
came across a summary of the Elliott Wave Theory;
that was the beginning of this pioneering analyst's
career. After researching all available materipl, Mr.
Neely realized there were many unanswered ques·
lions regarding proper Theory application. Over a
period of time he discovered other price patterns, not
discussed by R. N. Elliott, which classified previously
unexplained behavior. The need for greater fore·
casting accuracy was the impetus of Mr. Neely's ten
year quest for a scientific, objective process of Elliott
Wave analysis. Finally having obtained that goal,
his resulting Elliott Wave philosophy, techniques an
sequential form of analysis are known as the Neely
Method. For the first time, the results of his decade
long search are meticulously presented in "Master·
ing Elliott Wave" to improve your understanding of
market dynamics, your trading acumen and, most
importantly, your bottom line.
Mr. Neely has appeared on CNN and numerous
financial radio talk shows, been a guest speaker at
the International Headquarters for the Foundation for
the Study of Cycles, conducted several seminars on
Elliott Wave and Gann techniques, written articles
forllCydes" magazine and.has spoken before the
Market Technicians Association. He frequently
appears on Financial News Nelwork (FNN) and is
often quoted by Jeff Bower on FNN' s "Guru Revue."
Mr. Neely spends most of his business time doing
research, personally teaching his Method to a hand·
ful of serious market students and pioneering new
ideas in the field of Elliott Wave and Gann Analysis.
He also enjoys working on computer plotting and
dato manipulation programs along with proprietary
forecasting and trading techniques. Currently, Mr.
Neely is planning many new and exciting projects for
the future. Weareproudtobeapartin bringing you
